# Pi ↔ OpenCode: Intentional Divergences

This document records **deliberate** differences between the Pi plugin
(`packages/pi-plugin/`) and the OpenCode plugin (`packages/plugin/src/hooks/magic-context/`).

**For auditors (human, Oracle, or council):** the items below are NOT bugs. They
are architectural consequences of how Pi differs from OpenCode. Do not flag them
as parity gaps. If you believe one is wrong, argue against the *rationale* here —
don't just report "Pi differs from OpenCode."

The two implementations share a single SQLite DB (`cortexkit/magic-context`) and
the same `packages/plugin/src` core (storage, decay rendering, tag-transcript,
search). They must produce the **same effective behavior** (cache stability,
overflow protection, decay tiers), but the *mechanism* differs where the host
runtimes differ. "Same effective behavior, different mechanism" is the rule.

---

## 1. Pi has no native subagents → no reduced-mode (`fullFeatureMode`) gate

**OpenCode:** users spawn native subagents (via `task()`), which share the
plugin process and reach `experimental.chat.messages.transform`. OpenCode gates
historian / m[0]m[1] injection / nudges / auto-search behind `fullFeatureMode`
(i.e. `!isSubagent`), and detects subagents via OpenCode's `session.parent_id`.

**Pi:** Pi has **no native subagent concept**. The *only* subagents that exist
are the ones Magic Context itself spawns (historian, dreamer, sidekick), and each
runs as a **separate `pi --print` process** loading only the lean
`subagent-entry.js`, whose recursion guard **never wires `pi.on("context")`**
(see `subagent-entry.ts` header). A Pi subagent therefore *cannot* reach the
context-handler pipeline at all.

**Consequence:** `is_subagent` is **never written `true`** for any Pi session.
There is nothing to gate, so Pi does NOT need OpenCode's `fullFeatureMode`
reduced-mode enforcement in `context-handler.ts`. The vestigial `!isSubagent`
checks that exist in the Pi context handler are harmless (always take the
non-subagent branch); they are not the enforcement OpenCode has and adding that
gate would be dead code.

> Recurring false positive: blind councils pattern-match OpenCode's subagent
> gate onto Pi and report "reduced mode not enforced." It does not apply.

---

## 2. Placeholder stripping: Pi REMOVES (splices); OpenCode NEUTRALIZES (sentinel)

**OpenCode** (`strip-content.ts`): replaces a placeholder-only message's parts
with a single empty-text **sentinel**, leaving the message in the array so the
array length / structure stays stable for proxy caches. Safe to run discovery on
any execute pass.

**Pi** (`strip-placeholders-pi.ts`): Pi rebuilds `AgentMessage[]` from JSONL every
pass, so there is no need to preserve array structure — it **splices** the
message out entirely.

**Consequence:** Pi gates placeholder *discovery* to **history-refresh passes
only** (`args.isCacheBusting`), NOT the broader `shouldApplyPendingOps ||
shouldRunHeuristics` OpenCode uses. A freshly-dropped tool stub renders as
`[dropped §N§]`, which `isDroppedOnlyText` matches — so discovering on the *same
execute pass that created the drop* would splice out the just-dropped turn and
collapse it. Discovery is therefore deferred to the next refresh boundary;
replay still runs every pass. (This was learned the hard way — broadening the
gate to `executedWorkThisPass` caused a turn-collapse regression.)

Both harnesses **never neutralize/remove user-role messages** — they anchor turn
boundaries. In Pi's raw array tool results carry role `"toolResult"`; the
synthetic-user folds live only in the transcript *view* (never written back), so
only genuine prompts are user-role in the stripped array.

Pi has no `makeSentinel` empty-text-part wire path; the empty-part-sentinel
provider gate is OpenCode-only by construction.

---

## 3. No `session.deleted` event → `session_before_switch` is reversible

**OpenCode:** `session.deleted` is terminal — the session is gone. OpenCode's
handler clears both in-memory maps AND durable per-session DB state.

**Pi:** Pi has no `session.deleted`. The closest event is
`session_before_switch`, which fires when the user switches *away* — but the
session can be switched back. So the Pi switch handler clears **only in-memory
maps** (the actual per-swap leak) and must **NOT** clear durable DB caches
(`cached_m0_*`, boundary). Clearing the durable m[0] cache on switch would force
a full re-materialization (cache bust) on switch-back. The DB cache is bounded
(one `session_meta` row) and self-invalidates via epoch/version/docs-hash.

`clearSession()` (full durable cleanup) only runs where Pi has a genuine terminal
signal; it is intentionally NOT wired to `session_before_switch`.

---

## 4. Pi owns compaction via `session_before_compact`

**Pi** cancels native Pi compaction (`session_before_compact` → `{cancel:true}`)
and owns the boundary itself: Magic Context stages a native compaction marker
(`pending_pi_compaction_marker_state`) and drains it on the next materializing
pass so `getBranch()` returns the compacted tail. The **wire/context trim**
(`trimPiMessagesToBoundary`) runs every injection pass **independent** of the
native JSONL marker — so even if the marker lags (e.g. a crash window), the
model-visible context is still trimmed. OpenCode uses its own
deferred-compaction-marker mechanism (`compaction-marker.ts`); the two are
mechanism-parallel, not identical.

---

## 5. Pi rebuilds `AgentMessage[]` from JSONL every pass

**Consequence:** Pi does not need OpenCode's in-place sentinel persistence for
array-shape stability. Byte-stability across defer passes is achieved by
replaying persisted state (tags, dropped-status, `stripped_placeholder_ids`,
note/sticky anchors, caveman depth, `source_contents`) deterministically each
pass. The transcript adapter's `commit()` writes part-level mutations back into
the source array for dirty indices only.

---

## 6. Transient UI: Pi uses `ctx.ui.notify` toasts, not persistent dialogs

**OpenCode:** TUI dialogs (upgrade prompt, `/ctx-status`, `/ctx-recomp`, `/ctx-embed`, `/ctx-flush`) via RPC,
with an ignored-message fallback for Desktop/Web. Notification drain is
**session-scoped** (a notification tagged for one session never surfaces in
another) because one process can serve multiple sessions and TUI port discovery
is newest-pid-wins.

**Pi:** transient terminal notifications. The upgrade reminder passes
`deliveryPersists=false` on Pi, so it does NOT durably stamp `upgrade_reminded_at`
on display (the toast vanishes, leaving no scrollback) — it re-prompts each Pi
start until the session is actually upgraded. OpenCode (persistent chat message)
stamps on send.

---

## 7. Storage & process model

- Pi sessions are JSONL (`~/.pi/agent/sessions/*.jsonl`); OpenCode uses its own
  SQLite DB. Both write the *shared* Magic Context DB, tagged with a `harness`
  discriminator on session-scoped tables.
- Pi subagents spawn via `PiSubagentRunner` (`pi --print --mode json`). Large
  prompts (> ~96 KiB, e.g. a 50K-token historian chunk) are delivered via piped
  **stdin** (Pi concatenates stdin + positional) to avoid Linux `MAX_ARG_STRLEN`
  / E2BIG; the positional is omitted when piping.
- `--no-session` keeps subagent JSONL out of the user's session picker.

---

## 8. Pi-only mechanisms (no OpenCode counterpart)

- **`synth-user-<realId>` folding:** Pi folds runs of `toolResult` entries into a
  synthetic user message (the toolResult→assistant transition). Tail tool-result
  runs (no following user) get a `synth-user-<firstToolResultEntryId>` id so the
  tail tool output is taggable/droppable. Consumers handle the prefix differently
  by design: compaction-boundary selection (`findFirstKeptEntryId`) **defers**
  (returns null) on a synthetic boundary; boundary trim **resolves** it to the
  underlying real entry id.
- **`pi_stable_id_scheme` (migration v25):** a one-time forced-execute cutover
  that re-keys persisted tag/drop/caveman/placeholder state from `pi-msg-<index>`
  ids to real `SessionEntry` ids. OpenCode has stable message ids natively.
- **`syntheticLeadingCount`:** anchor-GC excludes the id-less m[0]/m[1] synthetic
  prepends from its "all messages resolved" denominator. OpenCode messages all
  have intrinsic `info.id`, so it has no such id-less injected messages to exclude.
- **Dynamic `upgradeState`:** Pi derives `upgradeState` from the presence of
  legacy compartments at runtime.

---

## 8a. Transform-decision attribution binds one prompt later

**OpenCode:** `message.updated` carries the finalized assistant `messageID`, so
Magic Context can bind the in-memory transform decision to that id as soon as the
terminal token update arrives.

**Pi:** the context event's `AgentMessage` has no stable id, and at `message_end`
the assistant `SessionEntry` wrapper has not been appended yet. Pi therefore
records the transform decision in memory with a snapshot of the newest assistant
entry id seen at pass start, then resolves it at the start of the next context
pass by finding the newest assistant `SessionEntry.id` different from that
snapshot. The dashboard keys Pi cache rows on that wrapper id, so this delayed
bind is the first point where the correct durable key exists. The final turn's
decision is written on the next prompt; that is accepted telemetry behavior.

---

## 9. ctx_reduce nudges — same effect, different delivery mechanism

The ctx_reduce nudge system (Channels 1 & 2) shares ALL metric math with OpenCode
via `@magic-context/core/.../ctx-reduce-nudge` (`decideChannel1`, `computePressure`,
`shouldTriggerChannel2`, both reminder builders, `tailToolTokensFromStrings`). Only
the harness I/O differs:

- **Channel 1 (in-turn tool-output nudge).** OpenCode appends the
  `<system-reminder>` to a tool's `output.output` string in `tool.execute.after`;
  Pi appends a `TextContent` block to `toolResult.content[]` in
  `pi.on("tool_result")` (returning `{ content: [...event.content, block] }`). Both
  persist (OpenCode→DB, Pi→JSONL via `appendMessage` on `message_end`) and replay
  verbatim — "free sticky", no anchor/CAS/replay machinery. The metric baseline is
  computed at the end of the pipeline (`pi.on("context")` / OpenCode transform) and
  read in the tool hook. The cadence/band state (`last_nudge_undropped` +
  `last_nudge_level`) is shared DB state so both harnesses suppress same-band
  repetition and reset after `ctx_reduce`. Pi tool output lives in
  `toolResult.content[].text`, not OpenCode's `parts[].state.output` —
  `computeTailToolTokensPi` extracts it, then defers to the shared
  `tailToolTokensFromStrings`.

- **Channel 2 (hidden ceiling nudge).** OpenCode MUST use a live-server
  `createOpencodeClient(serverUrl)` + `/session` probe to dodge the plugin
  runner-split bug (anomalyco/opencode#28202); Pi just calls the native
  `pi.sendMessage({ customType, content, display:false, details }, { deliverAs })`.
  **Pi has no #28202 workaround, no live-server client, and no probe** — it is
  single-process, so the message coalesces natively and lands at the tail after
  the current turn. **Hidden-render divergence (same intent, different mechanism):**
  OpenCode marks its promptAsync part `synthetic: true` (skips OC core's
  queued-message wrapper + the #129 flip-bust, drops from the user-message render,
  still model-visible); Pi has no such wrapper, so it achieves the same
  "model-visible but not a literal user turn" via a `sendMessage` custom message
  with `display:false` (Pi converts `role:"custom"`→user message for the model
  via convertToLlm, renders only when `display:true`). Neither presents the nudge
  as a user turn. The shared `channel2_nudge_state` lease
  (pending→claimed→delivered, TTL-scoped stale-claim heal, revert only on send
  failure) is used identically for the one-ceiling-per-lifetime cap; only the
  delivery call differs. Both
  deliver MID-TURN at step boundaries (the point
  of the channel: warn while the pile grows): OpenCode from `message.updated`
  (finish=tool-calls OR stop, queued message drains at the next run-loop step);
  Pi primarily from `tool_result` with deliverAs "steer" (queued, pulled at the
  next step), with `agent_end` + "followUp" as the idle fallback.

- **Removed in this redesign (both harnesses):** the rolling/iteration nudge
  (`nudger`/`injectPiNudge`/`nudge-injector.ts`) and the tool-heavy sticky reminder
  (`applyStickyTurnReminder`, `setPersistedStickyTurnReminder`, the `<instruction
  name="ctx_reduce_turn_cleanup">` text). Pi's now-removed `recordPiToolExecution`
  / `toolUsageSinceUserTurn` tracking backed only the deleted sticky reminder.
  Note-nudges and auto-search hints are UNCHANGED (still append to user messages
  via `appendReminderToUserMessageByIdPi`).

---

## 9b. Pi floors persisted pressure with live forward usage

**OpenCode:** pressure is refreshed per step through `message.updated` /
`step-finish`, so a tool-heavy turn sees context usage climb before the next
request is assembled. OpenCode also performs its own step-finish overflow check,
so no explicit forward floor is needed in the shared pressure path.

**Pi:** `message_end` persists `lastContextPercentage` only after the whole turn.
During a long multi-step turn that value can stay frozen while the live
`AgentMessage[]` grows. Pi therefore floors both scheduler and historian trigger
pressure with `ctx.getContextUsage().tokens`, which is recomputed from the live
message array each context pass.

The floor scales only the forward-pressure denominator (`contextLimit × 0.85`)
to compensate for Pi's estimate-token undercount. It does **not** mutate the real
context limit, and it passes the raw forward token count onward so emergency drop
planning still sees the current assembled size. The floor is monotonic: it never
lowers the persisted pressure, and missing/null forward usage preserves the old
behavior. Earlier Channel 1/2 ctx_reduce nudges can result because their
usable/reclaimable math consumes the same corrected input-token reading; those
nudges are persisted/replayed like the rest of Pi's sticky context hints.

Emergency drops remain cache-stable: repeated force passes on the same provider
usage sample are latched by `last_emergency_input_sample`, fresh same-turn
forward growth may force another pass, and a no-candidate force pass leaves wire
bytes unchanged.

---

## 10. Cleared reasoning: Pi EMPTIES (drops signature); OpenCode writes `[cleared]`→sentinel, gated

When Magic Context clears an aged reasoning/thinking block, the two harnesses use
DIFFERENT mechanisms because their serializers differ. The divergence is
deliberate and source-justified.

- **OpenCode** (`clearOldReasoning` + `stripClearedReasoning`, `strip-content.ts`):
  rewrites the thinking text to `[cleared]`, then — **only for canonical Anthropic**
  (`canUseEmptySentinels === providerID==="anthropic"`) — replaces the whole part
  with an empty *text* sentinel that `@ai-sdk/anthropic` drops before the wire
  (signature gone). For NON-canonical providers OpenCode now **gates the clear OFF
  entirely** (reasoning left intact), because OpenCode's non-Anthropic adapters
  forward empty parts and would otherwise leave a literal `[cleared]` (or a stale
  signature) on the wire. (#162 D2.)

- **Pi** (`reasoning-replay-pi.ts`): EMPTIES the thinking text (`thinking = ""`)
  and **drops the now-stale `thinkingSignature`**, with NO per-provider gate —
  EXCEPT it leaves `redacted` thinking blocks **untouched**. Every Pi serializer
  drops an *empty non-redacted* thinking block before the wire — `anthropic.ts`
  (empty thinking skipped), `openai-completions.ts` (filtered out of
  `nonEmptyThinkingBlocks`, with `reasoning_content=""` auto-filled for providers
  that require it), `amazon-bedrock.ts`/`google-shared.ts`/`mistral.ts` (empty
  thinking skipped). So no normal block and no signature reach ANY provider, which
  structurally eliminates the stale-signature mismatch and needs no gate.
  **Redacted blocks are the exception**: they serialize `redacted` BEFORE the
  empty-thinking check (`transform-messages.ts`, `anthropic.ts`), so emptying one
  + dropping its signature would put a malformed redacted block (no data, no sig)
  on the wire. They carry no plaintext to save, so Pi keeps them verbatim — safe
  and byte-stable.

Why the OLD "keep the signature" note was wrong: a `thinkingSignature` is a
cryptographic signature over the ORIGINAL thinking text, so `[cleared]` (or any
rewrite) + the original signature is a content/signature MISMATCH on canonical
Claude/Bedrock — a real 400 hazard, not a safe no-op. Both harnesses now ensure
no rewritten-with-stale-signature thinking block reaches the wire: OpenCode by
dropping the empty sentinel (canonical only) / not clearing (otherwise), Pi by
emptying so its serializers drop the block. `clearOldReasoning` only touches OLD
assistants (≥ `clear_reasoning_age` tags back); the latest assistant keeps its
real reasoning on both harnesses.

---

## 10. m[1] recompute gate uses Pi pipeline work, not history-refresh flag

OpenCode gates m[1] recompute on `isCacheBustingPass` (`shouldApplyPendingOps || shouldRunHeuristics`); Pi gates on `executedWorkThisPass || rematerialized` — same effective set, different assembly.

---

## 11b. Recomp / upgrade run detached in the background (mechanism differs, behaviour matches)

`/ctx-recomp` and `/ctx-session-upgrade` run DETACHED on both harnesses — the
REPL/TUI stays responsive while the multi-pass historian recomp runs — but the
mechanism differs because the process models differ:

- **OpenCode** runs `void runManagedRecomp(...)` / `void runManagedUpgrade(...)`
  in its separate server process; the TUI client keeps accepting input and shows
  a live progress bar via RPC polling.
- **Pi** is a single-process REPL where the command handler IS the turn, so an
  inline `await` froze all input. Pi instead spawns the recomp via
  `spawnPiRecompRun` (mirroring `spawnPiHistorianRun`): the handler returns
  immediately after the ack message, the run is tracked in an in-flight map for
  `session_shutdown` drain, and progress surfaces through `[ctx-status]`
  messages + the `recomp` status-line flag.

Because Pi's recomp runs in the background (not inside the user's turn), its
post-publish signals are the DEFERRED variants (`signalPiDeferredHistoryRefresh`
/ `signalPiDeferredMaterialization`) and the compaction marker is STAGED (pending
blob + deferred drain), never applied eagerly — exactly like the background
historian's `onPublished`. Eager signals / eager marker apply would force a
materialization (or mutate `getBranch()`) on whatever transform pass is running,
possibly mid-turn, busting the cache.

## 11. Work-metrics: Pi folds the in-memory wire array; OpenCode computes lazily in RPC

The TUI/status "work metrics" (new-work / total-input tokens) are a display-only
value. The two harnesses compute it from different sources, so the cost profiles
differ and the fixes differ:

- **Pi** (`context-handler.ts`) calls `computePiWorkMetrics(outputMessages)` — a
  fold over the already-in-memory wire array, bounded by the on-wire message
  count. It is cheap per pass and stays where it is.
- **OpenCode** previously called `computeOpenCodeWorkMetrics` on every transform
  pass — a window-function `json_extract` scan over EVERY assistant row of the
  session in OpenCode's DB (O(session age); ~250ms/pass at 47K rows). That was
  removed from the transform hot path. OpenCode now computes it lazily and
  incrementally in `buildSidebarSnapshot` (the only consumer) via
  `computeOpenCodeWorkMetricsIncremental` + a per-process watermark carry.

Pi does NOT need the incremental watermark machinery because its source is the
bounded wire array, not an ever-growing DB table. Do not "port" the OpenCode
lazy/incremental path to Pi — it would be solving a cost Pi does not have.

## 12. m[0] upgrade-state marker: both harnesses are dynamic (parity)

Both harnesses derive a per-session m[0] upgrade-state marker dynamically and use
it as a HARD-bust trigger so an upgraded session re-materializes m[0]. OpenCode
computes `getUpgradeState`; Pi computes `${PI_M0_UPGRADE_STATE}:${legacy|ready}`
from the presence of legacy compartments at render time
(`inject-compartments-pi.ts`), and the materialize stale-check compares it
(`current.upgradeState !== snapshotMarkers.upgradeState`).

This is **parity**, not a divergence. (Earlier revisions of this doc described
Pi's marker as a pinned constant — that is stale: Pi gained its own legacy→v2
`/ctx-session-upgrade` flow and the marker was made dynamic to refold m[0] when a
session crosses from legacy to upgraded. Pi's detached recomp/upgrade —
divergence #11b — additionally re-signals materialization through its own path.)

---

## 13. Instance-disposal cleanup: OpenCode `server.instance.disposed`, Pi `session_shutdown`

OpenCode wires the SDK `server.instance.disposed` event to an orderly per-instance
cleanup (stop the RPC server, unregister the dream-schedule timer, abort the
auto-update controller), gated on the disposed `directory` resolving to the
instance's own project identity (Desktop runs many instances per process, each
disposed independently). Pi has no `server.instance.disposed` event — it does the
equivalent teardown in its existing `session_shutdown` handler (drain in-flight
historian, etc.). Neither harness disposes the native ONNX embedding session on
teardown: forcing onnxruntime-node's destructor makes the Bun N-API exit crash
worse (tracked upstream at oven-sh/bun#30291); the OS reclaims that memory on exit.

---

## Schema-fence rejection surface

When the shared cross-harness `context.db` is migrated to a schema newer than
this binary supports, `openDatabase()` fail-closes (returns null) and the plugin
disables itself. Both harnesses log the reason. The **user-facing** surface
differs by necessity:

- **OpenCode** sends an ignored chat message via `sendSchemaFenceWarning`
  (Desktop has no visible console, so a silent disable would be invisible to the
  user). Gated on `getSchemaFenceRejection()`.
- **Pi** emits a terminal `warn()` only. Pi's fence check runs at extension
  init, before any session `ctx`/`ctx.ui` exists (it early-returns before
  registering hooks), and Pi always runs in a terminal where the log line is
  directly visible — so the OpenCode "invisible disable" failure mode does not
  apply. Adding a chat-surface warning would require deferring the fence check
  past hook registration, which contradicts fail-closed-before-any-work.

Same effective behavior (fail closed + tell the user); different delivery
because only OpenCode Desktop can hide the log.

---

## 14. Context-limit source: OpenCode reads the SDK; Pi reads its own runtime

Neither harness reads OpenCode's `models.json` (models.dev) file anymore — that
redundant read produced torn-read garbage (a 6748 "limit" for a session that had
run for hours) and let a stale on-disk copy out-vote the live auth-resolved cap
(922k vs the real Codex-OAuth 400k). Each harness now resolves the limit from its
own authoritative runtime source, then bounds it to a sane `[20k, 3M]` range
(shared `isSaneLimit`):

- **OpenCode** warms `apiCache` from the SDK `config.providers()` (OpenCode's
  fully-resolved config: models.dev + snapshot + opencode.json + auth-plugin
  caps), persisted for cold-start. `getSdkContextLimit()` returns the SDK value
  or `undefined`. Pi never warms `apiCache`, so for Pi that getter is unused.
- **Pi** resolves from its own runtime: `getContextUsage().contextWindow`,
  falling back to `ctx.model.contextWindow` (available at model-select, before
  any message). The detected-overflow limit still overrides both. This is Pi's
  equivalent of OpenCode's SDK — instant and auth-correct — so Pi does not call
  `getSdkContextLimit`/`resolveContextLimit`/`resolveTrustedContextLimit` at all.

Same effective behavior (authoritative per-harness limit, sane-bounded, overflow
override); different source because each harness exposes the resolved window
through a different API. Pi resolves that window once per trigger evaluation and
uses the same value for the trigger budget, boundary snapshot, and historian
runner stale-snapshot check; when the trigger re-resolves a scaled boundary, the
runner receives that trigger snapshot rather than the earlier probe snapshot.

---

## 15. HARD-bust tool-set hash: Removed on both harnesses

The m[0]/m[1] materialization decision (`mustMaterialize` / `mustMaterializePi`)
folds m[1] into m[0] on a HARD bust — a provider-side cache-eviction event where
the prompt cache was already dead, so folding is "free". The HARD trigger set is
identical across harnesses: model/provider change, system-prompt-hash change,
and idle>TTL.

The tool-set hash trigger was previously used to detect tool changes, but was
removed on both harnesses because the signal is process-global and produced
false-positive folds. Pi and OpenCode now both operate without this trigger.

---

## 16. Emergency-recovery disarm: Pi disarms inline; OpenCode uses a counter escape

Both harnesses face the same hazard: `needs_emergency_recovery` armed by an
overflow that the user then resolves (e.g. `/ctx-recomp`), leaving a session at
low real pressure with a non-runnable tail. The flag must not keep force-bumping
pressure to 95% forever, but it MUST stay armed for a *genuine* overflow whose
tail is one in-progress arc (the window becomes runnable once the arc closes).

- **OpenCode** keeps the flag armed and stops only the disruptive bump via a
  counter escape: `recovery_no_eligible_head_count >= RECOVERY_NO_HEAD_LIMIT (2)`
  (`transform.ts`, `protected-tail-boundary.ts`). It never auto-clears; the flag
  is cleared by a successful historian publish, a model switch, or a successful
  `/ctx-recomp` (runManagedRecomp "done").

- **Pi** does NOT increment that counter, so it disarms inline instead: inside
  `maybeFireHistorian`'s no-fire branch, when recovery is armed, no historian is
  in flight, there is no runnable compartment window, AND **real** pressure
  (`usage.percentage`, not the 95% bump) is `< FORCE_MATERIALIZATION_PERCENTAGE`
  → clear the flag. The low-pressure gate is what makes this safe: a genuine
  overflow arc sits near the limit, so it stays armed (matching OpenCode's
  intent); only a stale flag (post-recomp ~20%) disarms.

Both also clear the flag on a successful `/ctx-recomp` (OpenCode runManagedRecomp
"done"; Pi `result.published`) — the recomp IS the overflow resolution.

---

## 17. Runaway hidden-agent loop: OpenCode needs an in-config step cap; Pi relies on subprocess-kill

A weak local model (e.g. llama.cpp with poor instruction-following) can get a
hidden agent (historian/dreamer/sidekick) stuck in an infinite tool-call loop
(issue #154). The protection differs because the spawn model differs:

- **OpenCode** spawns hidden agents as a child SESSION whose run loop is an
  independent **instance-scoped server fiber**. Our prompt-timeout's
  `controller.abort()` cancels only our client fetch — the fiber keeps re-calling
  the LLM, and the user's ESC only aborts the *main* session (no `parentID`
  cascade). So OpenCode needs TWO guards: (a) `steps`/`maxSteps` on the hidden
  agent config (`buildHiddenAgentConfig` in `index.ts`) so OpenCode force-
  terminates the run loop after N steps, and (b) `client.session.abort({id})` on
  timeout/external-abort (in the shared `promptWithTimeout`) to interrupt the
  server-side loop — `controller.abort()` and `session.delete` do NOT stop it.

- **Pi** spawns hidden agents as separate `pi --print` **subprocesses**
  (`PiSubagentRunner`) and **SIGTERMs the child process** on timeout/abort. Killing
  the process kills the loop — there is no detached continuation. So Pi is
  structurally bounded by `timeoutMs` without needing an in-config step cap. A
  sooner per-step cap would be a nicety (terminate before burning the full
  timeout of local compute), only if `pi --print` exposes one; the SIGTERM bound
  is sufficient for correctness.

Same effective guarantee (a runaway hidden agent cannot loop forever), different
mechanism (OpenCode: in-config step cap + server-side abort; Pi: subprocess-kill).

---

## 18. Dreamer v2 per-task model: delivered via the prompt body, applied differently

Dreamer v2 lets each task carry its own `model` (falling back to the dreamer-level
model). The scheduler's executor sets `body.model = { providerID, modelID }` on the
child-session prompt for the resolved per-task model — this is the SAME mechanism
on both harnesses (the executor is shared core). The application differs at the
client boundary:

- **OpenCode** passes `body.model` straight to `client.session.prompt`; the server
  honors it per call, so per-task models work with no extra plumbing.

- **Pi** has no server-side session model field on the prompt — the model is a
  spawn argument to `PiSubagentRunner` (`pi --print --model …`). Pi's dreamer
  client facade therefore READS `body.model` back out (`extractBodyModel`) and
  threads it into the subprocess spawn, falling back to the dreamer-level model
  when absent. Per-task `thinking_level` is currently NOT threaded per-task on Pi
  (the facade uses the dreamer-level `thinking_level`); per-task thinking is a
  deferred nicety, not a correctness gap.

Same effective behavior (each task runs on its configured model), different
application point (OpenCode: server honors `body.model`; Pi: facade reads it back
into the subprocess spawn args).

## 19. Dreamer v2 manual run: shared scheduler, harness-specific entry

`/ctx-dream` runs the v2 per-task scheduler's `runManualDream` on both harnesses
(shared core): no arg = run every enabled task whose gate passes; a task arg =
force-run that one task ignoring its gate. The only divergence is the wiring: the
OpenCode command handler calls `runManualDream` directly with a freshly-built
executor; Pi routes through `runPiDreamForProject` → the registered project's
`runManual`, reusing the same `PiSubagentRunner`-backed client facade the timer
uses. The dashboard cannot trigger a run on either harness (DB-only, no live
channel) — it reflects `task_schedule_state` read-only.

---

## 20. Refresh-primers investigation toolset: OpenCode has `aft_*`, Pi does not

The open-book `refresh-primers` task runs a locked, read-only code-investigation
agent (`dreamer-primer-investigator`) that digs into the CURRENT source to ground
a primer's answer. The agent is intentionally read-only — no `write`/`edit`/
`bash` (source safety) and no `ctx_memory`/`ctx_note` (a `ctx_memory` mutation
bumps the project memory epoch and busts m[0], breaking the primers cache-neutral
contract).

The investigation TOOLSET differs by harness, and this is a deliberate,
documented divergence — NOT a parity bug:

- **OpenCode** allow-list: `read, grep, glob, aft_outline, aft_zoom, aft_search,
  ctx_search` — including AST-aware navigation (`aft_*`).
- **Pi** strict `--tools` allow-list: `read, grep, find, ls, ctx_search` — Pi's
  own canonical read-only built-in set (`createReadOnlyToolDefinitions`) plus
  `ctx_search`. The `aft_*` tools are OpenCode-only and are never registered in
  Pi; adding them to the lean child extension would also risk the documented
  Bun/Node native-module collision that keeps historian out of the extension.

So Pi's investigation is structurally weaker (no AST-aware navigation) but
equally safe (same read-only + cache-neutral guarantee, enforced by the
registry-build allow-list). The agent is in `SEARCH_ONLY_SUBAGENT_TOOL_AGENTS`
(loads the lean extension so `ctx_search` is registered) but NOT in
`DREAMER_ACTION_AGENTS` (which would add `ctx_memory`).

Origin-tag emission (the historian tagging each primer candidate with its origin
compartment) IS mirrored across both harness historian runners — that part is
true parity.

## 21. Dreamer map-memories / verify prompts vs Pi tool names

Shared dreamer task prompts for **map-memories** and **verify** (and related
read-only code checks) were authored against OpenCode's tool surface: they mention
names like `glob`, `aft_search`, `aft_outline`, and `aft_zoom`. On Pi those agents
run under a strict `--tools` allow-list of Pi's own read-only built-ins only:
`read`, `grep`, `find`, `ls` (see `dreamer-memory-mapper` in
`subagent-runner.ts`). Pi never registers `glob` or any `aft_*` tool in child
subagent processes.

This is intentional — we do **not** fork the shared prompts per harness. The model
simply ignores tool names in the prompt that are not in its registry and uses
whatever read-only tools it actually has. That behavior is harmless for these
tasks (local code read + structured manifest output; the host applies DB writes).

Same pattern as §20 (refresh-primers investigator): OpenCode gets richer
navigation tools; Pi gets an equally safe, narrower built-in set.

## Maintenance

Update this file whenever a deliberate Pi↔OpenCode divergence is introduced or
changed. Point audit/council/Oracle briefs at it so intentional divergences are
not re-reported as bugs each round.

## 8. Protected-tail true-raw parity is text + tool I/O only

**OpenCode:** raw session reads preserve full provider part JSON, including
reasoning/thinking and image payload metadata. The protected-tail true-raw
estimator can count those categories directly.

**Pi:** transcript shaping deliberately drops thinking parts and image payloads
before the shared protected-tail core sees the folded OpenCode-shaped messages.
Pi still preserves text and tool invocation/result I/O, so protected-tail sizing,
tool-arc fencing, and historian eligibility are parity-tested for those fields.

**Consequence:** thinking/image token parity is a known provider-shape divergence
and is deferred. Tests should assert text + tool-I/O parity and separately track
Pi's expected undercount for thinking/images rather than treating it as a silent
regression.
