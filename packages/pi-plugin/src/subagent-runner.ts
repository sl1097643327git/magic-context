/**
 * Resolve the Pi CLI entry that should be spawned for historian/dreamer/
 * sidekick subagents.
 *
 * Why this isn't just "pi": when the Pi plugin runs inside an interactive
 * `pi` session, that user has the `pi` binary on PATH and `spawn("pi", ...)`
 * works. But in other deployment shapes the plugin runs without that:
 *   - CI runners and e2e harnesses: Pi is installed only into node_modules
 *     via `bun install` / `npm install`. No `pi` symlink on PATH.
 *   - npm-only user installs: same shape — `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`
 *     is in node_modules but its bin entry isn't globally linked.
 *   - Any environment where the user uses `npx` rather than the
 *     globally-installed Pi CLI.
 *
 * Strategy: try to resolve `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent`'s package.json
 * via Node's `require.resolve` rooted at this module, then spawn the
 * package's `dist/cli.js` directly. Pi's CLI ships with `#!/usr/bin/env node`
 * and npm sets the exec bit during install, so the OS spawns it under Node
 * with no extra runtime needed. Fall back to plain `pi` on PATH so the
 * happy path for interactive Pi users is unchanged.
 *
 * Returns null when resolution fails — caller falls back to "pi" on PATH.

/**
 * Pi-side implementation of `SubagentRunner`.
 *
 * Spawns `pi --print --mode json` as a child process and consumes its
 * NDJSON event stream over stdout until the `agent_end` event delivers
 * the full final message array. We extract the last assistant message's
 * concatenated text content and return it as the run result.
 *
 * Why subprocess instead of in-process?
 * - Pi's @earendil-works/pi-coding-agent has no in-process child-session
 *   API equivalent to OpenCode's `client.session.create() / .prompt()`.
 *   Sessions are tied to a SessionManager that runs the interactive UI
 *   loop, and the agent loop expects to own stdout/stderr.
 * - The print-mode subprocess path is the *only* officially supported
 *   single-shot invocation in Pi today, and it's stable: it emits a
 *   well-typed NDJSON event stream regardless of which provider/model
 *   is targeted. Spawning is more expensive (cold-start ~500ms) but
 *   subagent invocations already amortize that against many seconds of
 *   model latency, so the overhead is in the noise.
 *
 * Output protocol (each stdout line is one JSON object):
 *
 *   { type: "session", id, version, timestamp, cwd }
 *   { type: "agent_start" }
 *   { type: "turn_start" }
 *   { type: "message_start", message: { role, content, ... } }
 *   { type: "message_end",   message: { role, content, ... } }
 *   ... possibly more turn_start / message_start / message_end / turn_end on tool calls ...
 *   { type: "agent_end", messages: [ ... full final message array ... ] }
 *
 * The `agent_end` event is the authoritative final state. We ignore
 * intermediate `message_*` events for result extraction (we only need
 * the last assistant message's text).
 *
 * Failure modes we handle explicitly:
 * - `agent_end` arrives but the last assistant message has stopReason
 *   "error" or "aborted" → `model_failed` with the embedded errorMessage.
 * - Process exits non-zero before `agent_end` is observed → `non_zero_exit`.
 * - Process exits zero with no assistant result → `no_assistant`.
 * - Malformed JSON output before completion → `parse_failed`.
 * - Spawn itself fails (binary missing, permission denied) → `spawn_failed`.
 * - Caller's AbortSignal fires → kill the child + return `abort`.
 * - `timeoutMs` elapses before `agent_end` → kill + return `timeout`.
 *
 * What we deliberately don't expose:
 * - Tool call streaming. Subagents in Magic Context are configured with
 *   their own narrowed tool sets; if a model emits tool calls during a
 *   subagent run, those tools execute inside Pi's child process just
 *   fine — we just don't surface intermediate state to the caller.
 * - Per-turn token usage. Pi reports usage in each `message_end`, but
 *   the runner contract only returns the final assistant text. If the
 *   sidekick/historian/dreamer ever needs token accounting, we'll add
 *   a `usage` field to `SubagentRunResult.meta` rather than changing
 *   the core contract.
