/**
 * Slow historian, fast main agent.
 *
 * The single most important invariant in magic-context: when the main agent is
 * fast and historian is slow, the main agent MUST continue to work without
 * being blocked by historian. This test exercises that invariant end-to-end.
 *
 * Plugin constants that shape this test (see compartment-trigger.ts and
 * read-session-chunk.ts):
 *
 *   - PROTECTED_TAIL_USER_TURNS = 5
 *       → we need >= 11 user turns so the 6th-from-last sits at an ordinal
 *         that leaves >= 12 messages in the unsummarized tail.
 *   - MIN_PROACTIVE_TAIL_MESSAGE_COUNT = 12
 *       → the tail must hit this count OR MIN_PROACTIVE_TAIL_TOKEN_ESTIMATE
 *         for the proactive trigger (below 95%) to fire.
 *   - BLOCK_UNTIL_DONE_PERCENTAGE = 95
 *       → above this, transform BLOCKS on historian with a timeout. Our test
 *         keeps usage below 95% on purpose — we want to prove the non-blocking
 *         path works.
 *
 * Scenario:
 *   1. Send 11 low-token user turns to populate raw history (turns keep usage
 *      well below any threshold on their own).
 *   2. Turn 11's response carries a big input_tokens count (~45% of 200K) so
 *      the event-handler-driven trigger sees usage >= execute_threshold AND a
 *      meaningful tail, then flips compartmentInProgress.
 *   3. Turn 12 is the one transform passes where we observe historian starting.
 *      While historian is hanging for 8s inside the mock, we measure turn 12's
 *      wall-clock latency — it must be sub-second-range; well below 5s.
 *   4. Assert exactly ONE historian request was issued despite further main
 *      turns happening while the first historian run is still pending.
