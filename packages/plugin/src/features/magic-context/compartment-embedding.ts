/**
 * Compartment P1 embedding (v2 / E2).
 *
 * The LOCKED substrate decision: `p1_embedding` is computed + stored on EVERY
 * compartment publish, even though the historian no longer uses embedding to
 * pick its own reference block (that switched to recency). The embedding exists
 * for two consumers:
 *   - ctx_search semantic retrieval over compartments (E2 consumption),
 *   - future dreamer cross-compartment linking (e.g. "key-files 2 months ago
 *     ↔ key-files now").
 *
 * Fire-and-forget + best-effort, mirroring memory promotion: a missing/slow
 * embedding provider must never block or fail a historian publish. Gated by the
 * same `memory.enabled` / `auto_promote` flags as memory promotion (no embedding
 * endpoint hits when memory is off).

/**
 * Embed the P1 text of the given compartments and persist each vector into

 * `embedTextForProject` resolves the project's configured provider/model, so the
 * stored `model_id` stays consistent with memory embeddings for the same project
 * (vector compatibility for cross-corpus search later).
