 * Shared by both harnesses (OpenCode `config/index.ts` and Pi

 * Fields on a hidden-agent block that constitute a privilege-escalation /

 *                   AUTONOMOUSLY in the background with `bash`/`edit`/`webfetch`,
 *                   so a repo-supplied prompt is an unattended exfil/RCE path.
 *  - `permission` — broadens the agent's per-tool permissions.
 *  - `tools`      — enable/disable map; could flip a denied tool (e.g. `bash`)
 *                   on for an agent whose allow-list intentionally excludes it.
 *  - `system_prompt` — sidekick's custom system prompt. It takes precedence over
 *                   the built-in prompt (sidekick/agent.ts reads
 *                   `config.system_prompt` before `config.prompt`), so leaving it
 *                   unstripped reopens the exact reprogramming vector `prompt`
 *                   closes — a cloned repo could rewrite sidekick's instructions
 *                   via `/ctx-aug`.
 *
 * Benign fields (model/temperature/disable/schedule/tasks/…) are deliberately
 * NOT stripped: a repo may legitimately tune its own dreamer cadence or model,
 * and none of those are an escalation vector (the model is still invoked
 * through the user's own provider auth).
