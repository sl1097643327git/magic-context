# Configuration Reference

All settings are flat top-level keys in `magic-context.jsonc`. The schema is **shared between the OpenCode plugin and the Pi extension** — every setting documented here applies to both unless explicitly marked **Pi only** or **OpenCode only**.

### Key files (`dreamer.pin_key_files`)

`dreamer.pin_key_files.enabled: true` requires AFT to be registered in the active harness. OpenCode checks `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json[c]` for an AFT plugin entry; Pi checks `~/.pi/agent/settings.json` for `@cortexkit/aft-pi` in `packages` or `extensions`. If AFT is missing, key-files generation and injection soft-disable: Magic Context logs a warning, `doctor` reports the missing AFT configuration, and no `<key-files>` block is emitted.

Key files are project-scoped in SQLite. `project_key_files` stores one row per file, with LLM-stitched content and a plugin-computed `content_hash`; `project_key_files_version` stores the per-project version counter used to invalidate per-session prompt caches after Dreamer commits.

### Configuration locations

**OpenCode** reads (in priority order, project overrides user):

| Path | Scope |
|---|---|
| `<project>/magic-context.jsonc` | Project root |
| `<project>/.opencode/magic-context.jsonc` | Project, alternate location |
| `~/.config/opencode/magic-context.jsonc` | User-wide defaults |

**Pi** reads (in priority order, project overrides user):

| Path | Scope |
|---|---|
| `<project>/.pi/magic-context.jsonc` | Project root |
| `~/.pi/agent/magic-context.jsonc` | User-wide defaults |

Project config always merges on top of user config in both harnesses. The unified setup wizard (`npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest setup`) auto-detects which harnesses you have installed and writes the user-level file for each with sensible defaults; pass `--harness opencode` or `--harness pi` to target one.

### Cross-harness scoping

Both plugins write to the same SQLite database at `~/.local/share/cortexkit/magic-context/context.db`. Tables are scoped by:

- `harness` column (`'opencode'` or `'pi'`) for **session-scoped** data — tags, compartments, session facts, notes
- `project_path` (resolved git root) for **project-scoped** data — memories, embeddings, dreamer runs, key-file pins, smart notes

So memories you write in OpenCode appear in Pi sessions for the same project (and vice versa), while per-session compartments and tags stay correctly attributed to their originating harness.

For semantic search to work cross-harness, both plugins resolve embedding config per project identity on every retrieval path. OpenCode and Pi can run in the same process against different projects without sharing one process-global embedding provider. For one project, keep the effective `embedding` block consistent across the OpenCode and Pi config stack; Magic Context tags stored vectors with the resolved model identity and clears stale vectors for that project when the provider/model changes.

### JSON Schema

Add `$schema` to your config file for autocomplete and validation in VS Code and other editors:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cortexkit/magic-context/master/assets/magic-context.schema.json"
}
```

Both setup wizards add this automatically.

### Doctor

If something isn't working, run the unified doctor to auto-detect installed harnesses and fix common issues:

```bash
# Auto-detect installed harnesses; if both, picks the first or asks
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor

# Target a specific harness explicitly
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor --harness opencode
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor --harness pi
```

The OpenCode doctor checks: installation, CLI version vs npm latest, plugin registration (preserves local dev paths), `magic-context.jsonc` parses + loads through the schema, conflicts (compaction, DCP, OMO hooks), TUI sidebar configuration, embedding endpoint, shared-DB existence + `PRAGMA integrity_check` + row counts, plugin npm cache, and historian debug dumps.

The Pi doctor checks: Pi binary + version (requires `>= 0.71.0`), CLI version vs npm latest, settings registration, config validity, embedding endpoint reachability, shared-DB integrity, stale Pi extension caches, and historian debug dumps.

Both report `PASS X / WARN Y / FAIL Z` summary counts. Use `--force` to auto-fix what doctor can (clears stale plugin cache, repairs config) and `--issue` to produce a sanitized issue report.

### SQLite backend

Magic Context uses the runtime's built-in SQLite: `bun:sqlite` under Bun (OpenCode CLI/TUI) and `node:sqlite` under Node and Electron (Pi, OpenCode Desktop — Electron 41 embeds Node 24.14.1, which ships `node:sqlite` flag-free). There is no native module to install, no per-ABI prebuild, and nothing downloaded at runtime — the store works offline on first launch on every platform.

## Cache Awareness

LLM providers cache conversation prefixes server-side. The cache window depends on your provider and subscription tier — Claude Pro offers 5 minutes, Max offers 1 hour, and pricing for cached vs. uncached tokens differs between API and subscription usage.

Magic Context defers all mutations until the cached prefix expires. The default `cache_ttl` of `"5m"` matches most providers. You can tune it:

```jsonc
{
  "cache_ttl": "5m"
}
```

Per-model overrides for mixed-model workflows:

```jsonc
{
  "cache_ttl": {
    "default": "5m",
    "anthropic/claude-opus-4-6": "60m"
  }
}
```

Supported formats: `"30s"`, `"5m"`, `"1h"`.

Higher-tier models with longer cache windows benefit from a longer TTL. Setting it too low wastes cache hits. Setting it too high delays reduction on long sessions.

## Core

| Option | Type | Default | Description |
|--------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Master toggle. |
| `auto_update` | `boolean` | `true` | User-config-only plugin self-update toggle; project configs cannot disable it. |
| `ctx_reduce_enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | When `false`, hides `ctx_reduce` tool, disables all nudges/reminders, and strips reduction guidance from prompts. Heuristic cleanup, compartments, memory, and search still work. Useful for testing whether automatic cleanup alone is sufficient. |
| `cache_ttl` | `string` or `object` | `"5m"` | Time after a response before applying pending ops. String or per-model map. |
| `protected_tags` | `number` (1–100) | `20` | Last N active tags immune from immediate dropping. |
| `toast_duration_ms` | `number` (0–60000) | `5000` | TUI toast lifetime for Magic Context notifications in milliseconds. Increase this if toasts disappear too quickly, or set to `0` to disable Magic Context toasts entirely. |
| `execute_threshold_percentage` | `number` (20–80) or `object` | `65` | Context usage that forces queued ops to execute. Capped at 80% max for cache safety. Supports per-model map. |
| `execute_threshold_tokens` | `object` (per-model map) | — | **Optional absolute-tokens variant of `execute_threshold_percentage`.** Per-model map (e.g. `{ "default": 150000, "github-copilot/gpt-5.2-codex": 40000 }`). When set for a model, overrides the percentage-based threshold for that model. Clamped to `80% × context_limit` with a warn log. Requires a resolvable context limit — falls through to percentage if unavailable. See below. |
| `clear_reasoning_age` | `number` | `50` | Clear thinking/reasoning blocks older than N tags. |
| `historian_timeout_ms` | `number` | `300000` | Timeout per historian call (ms). |
| `history_budget_percentage` | `number` (0.05–0.5) | `0.15` | Fraction of usable context (`context_limit × execute_threshold`) reserved for the history block. Triggers compression when exceeded. |
| `commit_cluster_trigger` | `object` | See below | Controls the commit-cluster historian trigger. |
| `sqlite` | `object` | See below | Per-connection SQLite tuning for Magic Context's own `context.db`. |
| `compressor` | `object` | See below | Controls the background compressor that merges older compartments when the history block exceeds its budget. |

### `commit_cluster_trigger`

A **commit cluster** is a distinct work phase where the agent made one or more git commits, separated from other commit clusters by meaningful user turns. For example, if the agent commits a fix, then the user asks a new question, and the agent commits another change — that's 2 commit clusters. This heuristic detects natural work-unit boundaries and fires historian to compartmentalize them, even when context pressure is low.

```jsonc
{
  "commit_cluster_trigger": {
    "enabled": true,    // default: true
    "min_clusters": 3   // default: 3, minimum: 1
  }
}
```

### `sqlite`

Per-connection PRAGMAs applied to Magic Context's own `context.db` at open. These tune SQLite's runtime behaviour only — they do not change the schema or what is stored, and they do not touch OpenCode's or Pi's databases.

```jsonc
{
  "sqlite": {
    "cache_size_mb": 64,   // default: 64, min: 2, max: 2048 — page-cache size per connection
    "mmap_size_mb": 0      // default: 0 (disabled), min: 0, max: 8192 — memory-mapped I/O size
  }
}
```

- **`cache_size_mb`** — how much page cache each connection keeps resident (`PRAGMA cache_size`). The DB grows large on long-lived projects, and several hot paths do repeated full-table scans; a larger cache keeps those pages in memory instead of re-reading from disk. Raised from SQLite's ~2 MB default to **64 MB**.
- **`mmap_size_mb`** — memory-maps the database file (`PRAGMA mmap_size`) so reads avoid a copy through the page cache. Can reduce read overhead on large DBs at the cost of address space. **Disabled by default (`0`)**, matching SQLite's default; raise it (e.g. `256`) only if you want to experiment with read performance.

Separately, Magic Context runs `PRAGMA optimize` (bounded by `PRAGMA analysis_limit=400`) on its 15-minute maintenance tick. This is self-gating — it re-analyses a table only when its row count has drifted enough to matter — so the query planner keeps choosing good indexes as the database grows. There is no config knob for it.

### `compressor`

Compressor is a background pass that runs when the rendered `<session-history>` block exceeds its budget. It merges older compartments using progressively aggressive **caveman-style** compression at each depth level, enforcing style consistency via a deterministic post-process after the historian LLM call. Each compartment range can be compressed at most `max_merge_depth` times.

**Depth tiers** (applied progressively as compartments are re-compressed):

| Depth | Style | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | **Merge only** | Preserve narrative and all U: lines. Drop only duplicates spanning compartments. |
| 2 | **Lite caveman** | Drop filler words (just, really, basically) and hedging. Keep grammar. |
| 3 | **Full caveman** | Drop articles (the, a, an), weak auxiliaries. Fragments OK. Single paragraph per compartment. |
| 4 | **Ultra caveman** | Telegraphic. Symbol connectives (`→`, `+`, `//`, `\|`). Pattern: `[thing] [action] [reason]`. |
| 5 | **Title-only collapse** | Content cleared (no LLM call). Raw messages recoverable via `ctx_expand`. |

Inspired by the [caveman Claude Code skill](https://github.com/JuliusBrussee/caveman) which validated telegraph-style compression as LLM-friendly (and saves tokens without tokenizer fallback issues that character-dropping causes).

```jsonc
{
  "compressor": {
    "enabled": true,                  // default: true
    "min_compartment_ratio": 1000,     // default: 1000 (floor = ceil(total_raw_messages / ratio))
    "max_merge_depth": 5,             // default: 5 (1-5, deeper = more aggressive)
    "cooldown_ms": 600000,            // default: 600000 (10 min between background runs)
    "max_compartments_per_pass": 15,  // default: 15 (LLM batch cap)
    "grace_compartments": 10          // default: 10 (newest N compartments never compressed)
  }
}
```

**Merge ratios per depth** (applied per LLM pass — small ratios preserve more narrative):

| Depth transition | Ratio | Shape |
|---|---|---|
| 0 → 1 | 1.33× (4:3) | Narrative merge; preserve all `U:` lines |
| 1 → 2 | 1.5× (3:2) | Drop filler, keep grammar (caveman-lite) |
| 2 → 3 | 2× (2:1) | Paragraph, fragments OK (caveman-full) |
| 3 → 4 | 2× (2:1) | Telegraph + symbol connectives (caveman-ultra) |
| 4 → 5 | — | Title-only collapse (no LLM, recoverable via `ctx_expand`) |

**Selection strategy:** The compressor picks the oldest contiguous run of compartments that share the SAME rounded compression depth (up to `max_compartments_per_pass`). This progresses naturally: depth-0 bands get compressed first → depth-1 bands compressed next → and so on. Each run goes through one LLM call.

**Floor protection:** The compressor never reduces your session's compartment count below `ceil(total_raw_messages / min_compartment_ratio)`. For a 20K-message session with the default ratio, that's a floor of 20 compartments.

**Grace period:** The newest `grace_compartments` compartments are always excluded from compression. This protects freshly-published historian output from being re-compressed before it has been used. Default is 10, which works well even for long autonomous runs that publish many compartments per hour.

**Ordinal snap:** When the LLM drifts by ±1-2 ordinals on merged boundaries (e.g. outputs `start=8161` when the actual input boundary is `8160`), the runtime snaps those values to the enclosing input compartment's canonical boundary rather than rejecting the whole pass. Snaps are logged for observability.

**Disable entirely:** Set `compressor.enabled: false` to skip all background compression. Older sessions will simply carry a larger history footprint.


| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable commit-cluster based historian triggering. |
| `min_clusters` | `number` | `3` | Minimum number of commit clusters in the unsummarized tail before historian fires. The tail must also contain at least one `trigger_budget` worth of tokens, where `trigger_budget = main_context × execute_threshold × 5%` clamped to `[5K, 50K]`. |

Set `enabled: false` to disable this trigger entirely and rely only on pressure-based and tail-size triggers for historian.

### `execute_threshold_tokens`

An absolute-tokens alternative to `execute_threshold_percentage`. Useful when you want a hard cap expressed in tokens rather than a percentage — for example, when a provider limits effective prompt size below its advertised context window.

```jsonc
{
  "execute_threshold_tokens": {
    "default": 150000,                          // fires at 150K for any model without an explicit entry
    "github-copilot/gpt-5.2-codex": 40000       // fires at 40K specifically for gpt-5.2-codex
  }
}
```

**Behavior:**

- Per-model map only — no bare-number form. All sessions are assumed to have different context limits, so the `default` key acts as a fallback inside the map.
- **Tokens wins:** when a matching entry exists for the current model, it overrides the percentage-based threshold for that model. Other models continue to use `execute_threshold_percentage`.
- **Progressive key lookup** just like percentage config — `openai/gpt-5.4-fast` matches `openai/gpt-5.4` if the derived key is absent.
- **Clamped at 80% × context_limit** for the same cache-safety reason as percentage. If the clamp fires, a `log.warn` records the original and capped value.
- Requires a **resolvable context limit** at runtime. On brand-new sessions before any response arrives, the context limit is unknown — in that case, resolution falls through to `execute_threshold_percentage`. Once the first response lands, the correct tokens-based threshold is applied on the following turn.

**When to prefer tokens over percentage:**

- You hit a provider-side prompt cap (like GitHub Copilot's `max_prompt_tokens` ignoring user config overrides — see the github-copilot interaction in the project KNOWN_ISSUES).
- You want consistent compaction behavior across models with very different context window sizes.

**When to prefer percentage:**

- You want the threshold to scale proportionally with the model's window (bigger window → compacts later in absolute terms).
- You're not targeting a specific provider cap.

---

## Model Resolution

Each hidden agent (historian, dreamer, sidekick) uses the `model` you configure for it. There is **no built-in fallback chain** — Magic Context never silently tries models you haven't configured (a hardcoded chain inevitably names providers you don't have, producing confusing `Model not found` errors).

If the configured primary fails (auth, transient, or returns unusable output), the fallback order is:

1. Your explicit `fallback_models` for that agent, in order.
2. **Historian only:** your active session model, as a last resort (a model you're already using). The dreamer and sidekick use only their configured `fallback_models`.

If you set no `fallback_models`, a failing primary simply retries — it never jumps to an unconfigured model. Set `fallback_models` to add alternates of your own (each `"provider/model-id"`).

> **Tip — Dreamer with local models:** Since the dreamer runs during idle time (typically overnight), it works well with local models. Even slower ones like `ollama/mlx-qwen3.5-27b-claude-4.6-opus-reasoning-distilled` are fine — there's no user waiting.

### Advanced agent fields

All three agents (`historian`, `dreamer`, `sidekick`) accept these additional fields beyond the common `model`, `fallback_models`, `temperature`, `variant`, `prompt`. Most map directly to OpenCode's `AgentConfig` and pass through unchanged.

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `tools` | `{ [toolName: string]: boolean }` | Restrict which tools the agent can use. `{ "bash": false, "write": false }` disables those tools for this agent only. |
| `permission` | `object` | Per-agent permission overrides. Sub-fields: `edit`, `bash`, `webfetch`, `doom_loop`, `external_directory`. Each accepts `"ask"`, `"allow"`, or `"deny"`. `bash` additionally accepts a record form for per-command rules. |
| `disable` | `boolean` | Disable the agent without removing its config. Useful for toggling on/off during testing. |
| `description` | `string` | Agent description shown in OpenCode UI. |
| `mode` | `"subagent"` \| `"primary"` \| `"all"` | OpenCode agent mode. Magic Context internal agents run as `subagent`. |
| `top_p` | `number` (0–1) | Nucleus sampling. |
| `maxSteps` | `number` | Max reasoning steps per agent call. |
| `maxTokens` | `number` | Max output tokens. ⚠️ OpenCode does not currently consume this field for plugin-registered agents — setting it has no effect. Tracked in the project as a known limitation. |
| `color` | `string` (`#RRGGBB`) | Display color in OpenCode UI. |

Example — restricting historian to read-only tools and denying bash:

```jsonc
{
  "historian": {
    "model": "github-copilot/gpt-5.4",
    "tools": { "bash": false, "write": false, "edit": false },
    "permission": { "bash": "deny", "webfetch": "deny" }
  }
}
```

---

## `historian`

Configures the background historian agent that compresses session history into compartments.

```jsonc
{
  "historian": {
    "model": "github-copilot/gpt-5.4",
    "fallback_models": [
      "anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6",
      "bailian-coding-plan/kimi-k2.5"
    ],
    "two_pass": false
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model` | `string` | Primary model. |
| `fallback_models` | `string` or `string[]` | Models to try if the primary fails or is rate-limited. |
| `temperature` | `number` (0–2) | Sampling temperature. |
| `variant` | `string` | **OpenCode only.** Agent variant — selects a thinking/reasoning preset configured in OpenCode itself. Pi uses `thinking_level` instead. |
| `thinking_level` | `string` | **Pi only.** Explicit reasoning level passed to Pi when spawning the historian subagent (`off`, `low`, `medium`, `high`). Required for GitHub Copilot reasoning models on Pi — without it, Copilot injects `"minimal"` as a default and then rejects it (HTTP 400). The Pi setup wizard prompts for this when you pick a `github-copilot/*` model. |
| `prompt` | `string` | Custom system prompt override. |
| `two_pass` | `boolean` | Default `false`. When `true`, runs a second editor pass after each successful historian output. The editor (a separate hidden `historian-editor` agent using the same model resolution as the historian) re-reads the draft and removes low-signal `U:` lines, redundant paraphrases, and cross-compartment duplicates, producing cleaner narrative-first summaries. Falls back to the draft if the editor call or its validation fails, so it can never regress behavior. Adds one extra historian-scale call per compartment publication. Recommended for non-reasoning models and open-weight local models where the single-pass draft is noisier. For models with extended thinking/reasoning enabled in OpenCode (Claude 4+, GPT-5.x reasoning variants), the single-pass output is usually already clean and `two_pass` can stay `false`. |

---

## `dreamer`

Configures the dreamer agent — both the model it uses and the maintenance tasks it runs. Dreamer creates ephemeral child sessions inside OpenCode for each task.

Each dreamer task is **independently scheduled** with its own cron expression. There is no single dreamer "run" or time window — a process-wide timer runs whichever tasks are due.

```jsonc
{
  "dreamer": {
    "model": "github-copilot/gpt-5.4",
    "fallback_models": ["anthropic/claude-sonnet-4-6"],
    "tasks": {
      "consolidate": { "schedule": "0 3 * * *" },
      "verify": { "schedule": "0 3 * * *" },
      "archive-stale": { "schedule": "0 3 * * *" },
      "improve": { "schedule": "0 3 * * *" },
      "maintain-docs": { "schedule": "" },
      "key-files": { "schedule": "", "token_budget": 10000, "min_reads": 4 },
      "evaluate-smart-notes": { "schedule": "0 3 * * *" },
      "review-user-memories": { "schedule": "0 3 * * *", "promotion_threshold": 3 }
    }
  }
}
```

To disable the dreamer entirely, set `dreamer.disable: true`. To disable a single task, set its `schedule` to `""` (it can still be run on demand via `/ctx-dream <task>`).

### Agent fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model` | `string` | Default model for all tasks (each task may override). |
| `fallback_models` | `string` or `string[]` | Default fallback chain (each task may override). |
| `temperature` | `number` (0–2) | Sampling temperature. |
| `variant` | `string` | **OpenCode only.** Agent variant — selects a thinking/reasoning preset. Pi uses `thinking_level` instead. |
| `thinking_level` | `string` | **Pi only.** Explicit reasoning level (`off`/`low`/`medium`/`high`) passed to Pi for dreamer subagent runs. See `historian.thinking_level`. |
| `prompt` | `string` | Custom system prompt override. |
| `disable` | `boolean` | Set `true` to disable the dreamer agent entirely. |
| `inject_docs` | `boolean` (default `true`) | Inject ARCHITECTURE.md and STRUCTURE.md into the agent system prompt. Cached per-session and refreshed on cache-busting passes. |

### Per-task fields (`dreamer.tasks.<task>`)

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `schedule` | `string` | per task (below) | 5-field cron expression, or `""` to disable. |
| `model` | `string` | inherits `dreamer.model` | Per-task model override. |
| `fallback_models` | `string` or `string[]` | inherits `dreamer.fallback_models` | Per-task fallback chain. |
| `timeout_minutes` | `number` | `20` | Minutes allowed before the task is aborted. |
| `promotion_threshold` | `number` (2–20) | `3` | **review-user-memories only.** Min candidate observations before promotion. |
| `token_budget` | `number` (2k–30k) | `10000` | **key-files only.** Total token budget for pinned files. |
| `min_reads` | `number` (2–20) | `4` | **key-files only.** Min full-read count before a file is pinned. |

### The tasks

| Task | Default schedule | What it does |
|------|------------------|-------------|
| `consolidate` | `0 3 * * *` | Find semantically duplicate memories and merge each cluster into one canonical fact. |
| `verify` | `0 3 * * *` | Check memories against actual code (paths, configs, patterns) and update or archive stale ones. |
| `archive-stale` | `0 3 * * *` | Archive memories that reference removed features, old paths, or discontinued workflows. |
| `improve` | `0 3 * * *` | Rewrite verbose or narrative memories into terse operational statements. |
| `maintain-docs` | `""` (off) | Keep `ARCHITECTURE.md` and `STRUCTURE.md` at project root synchronized with the codebase. |
| `key-files` | `""` (off) | Pin frequently-read project files into a `<key-files>` block. Requires AFT (see above). |
| `evaluate-smart-notes` | `0 3 * * *` | Surface smart notes whose `ctx_note` conditions have come true. |
| `review-user-memories` | `0 3 * * *` | Promote recurring behavioral observations into the `<user-profile>` block (privacy-sensitive). |

### How scheduling works

A process-wide 15-minute timer checks every task's `next_due_at` regardless of user activity, so scheduled tasks trigger even when you aren't chatting:

1. The timer evaluates each task's cron schedule and collects the tasks that are due.
2. Due tasks pass their activity gate (e.g. consolidate only runs when there are memories to consolidate), then run grouped by lease domain — the four memory-mutating tasks (consolidate/verify/archive-stale/improve) share a per-project lease and run sequentially; the rest run independently.
3. Each task runs in its own ephemeral child session and advances its own `next_due_at`.
4. `/ctx-dream` runs every enabled task now (honoring gates); `/ctx-dream <task>` force-runs one task immediately, ignoring its gate.

A freshly-configured task first runs at its next scheduled time, not immediately on startup.

---

## `embedding`

Controls semantic search for cross-session memories.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `provider` | `"local"` \| `"openai-compatible"` \| `"off"` | `"local"` | `"local"` runs `Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2` in-process. `"off"` disables semantic ranking entirely — see below. |
| `model` | `string` | `"Xenova/all-MiniLM-L6-v2"` | Embedding model. |
| `endpoint` | `string` | — | Required for `"openai-compatible"`. |
| `api_key` | `string` | — | Optional API key for remote endpoints. |

When `provider: "off"`:

- No embeddings are generated. `ctx_memory(write)` skips embedding inline and the background embedding sweep becomes a no-op.
- `ctx_search` and memory injection fall back to FTS5 (BM25) ranking only. Keyword matches still work; semantic similarity does not.
- Session-start memory injection still happens when `memory.enabled` is `true` — memories are ordered by utility tier plus `seen_count` rather than semantic similarity to the current turn.
- Memories written while `off` is active will have no embedding row; if you later re-enable `"local"` or `"openai-compatible"`, the background sweep embeds them on the next 15-minute tick.

```jsonc
{
  "embedding": {
    "provider": "openai-compatible",
    "model": "text-embedding-3-small",
    "endpoint": "https://api.openai.com/v1",
    "api_key": "{env:OPENAI_API_KEY}"
  }
}
```

> **Note:** Any string in `magic-context.jsonc` can use `{env:VAR}` to reference an environment variable, or `{file:path}` to inline the contents of an external file (matching OpenCode's own config substitution). Paths are resolved relative to the config file's directory; `~/` expands to the home directory. Use `doctor` after editing — it probes the configured embedding endpoint and reports missing env vars, wrong URLs, auth failures, or providers that don't implement the embeddings API.

> **Not every provider offers embeddings.** OpenRouter and Anthropic's public API do not expose `/embeddings`; use OpenAI, Voyage, Together, LM Studio, or the bundled `"local"` provider instead. `doctor` will flag 404/405 responses and show the actual error.

---

## `memory`

Cross-session memory settings. All memories are scoped to the current project (identified by git root commit hash, with directory-hash fallback for non-git projects).

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `true` | Enable cross-session memory. When `false`, the `ctx_memory` tool is hidden, no `<project-memory>` block is injected, and historian/recomp do not promote any session facts to project memories. The `ctx_search` tool stays available but its memory source returns no results. |
| `injection_budget_tokens` | `number` (500–20000) | `4000` | Token budget for memory injection into `<session-history>`. |
| `auto_promote` | `boolean` | `true` | Promote eligible session facts to project memories automatically after historian or `/ctx-recomp` runs. When `false`, historian and recomp do not write any new memories — agents can still create memories explicitly via `ctx_memory write`, and existing memories continue to be injected and searched normally. |
| `retrieval_count_promotion_threshold` | `number` | `3` | Retrievals needed before a memory is auto-promoted to permanent. |

## `sidekick`

Optional prompt augmenter that runs on `/ctx-aug`. Sidekick is a hidden OpenCode subagent that creates an ephemeral child session, searches memories with `ctx_memory`, and returns a focused context briefing. 
It is useful when starting a new session. It's better to choose a fast and cheap model, even small local models.

```jsonc
{
  "sidekick": {
    "enabled": true,
    "model": "github-copilot/grok-code-fast-1",
    "fallback_models": ["cerebras/qwen-3-235b-a22b-instruct-2507"],
    "timeout_ms": 30000
  }
}
```

### Agent fields

| Field | Type | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| `model` | `string` | Primary model. |
| `fallback_models` | `string` or `string[]` | Fallback models. |
| `temperature` | `number` (0–2) | Sampling temperature. |
| `variant` | `string` | **OpenCode only.** Agent variant — selects a thinking/reasoning preset. Pi uses `thinking_level` instead. |
| `thinking_level` | `string` | **Pi only.** Explicit reasoning level (`off`/`low`/`medium`/`high`) passed to Pi for sidekick subagent runs. See `historian.thinking_level`. |
| `prompt` | `string` | Persistent agent-level system prompt override. Applies to every sidekick run. |

### Operational fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|-------|------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Enable sidekick. |
| `timeout_ms` | `number` | `30000` | Timeout per run (ms). |
| `system_prompt` | `string` | — | Per-invocation system prompt prepended to the sidekick child session for this `/ctx-aug` call only. Layered on top of `prompt` if both are set. |

> **`prompt` vs `system_prompt`:** `prompt` is the persistent agent definition applied to every sidekick run. `system_prompt` is a per-call override injected into that specific child session — useful when a single `/ctx-aug` invocation needs different guidance than the default.

## Dreamer Sub-Features

In Dreamer v2 the former `user_memories` and `pin_key_files` sub-feature blocks became first-class scheduled tasks: **`review-user-memories`** and **`key-files`** (see the `dreamer.tasks` table above). The `doctor` command migrates a legacy `dreamer.user_memories` / `dreamer.pin_key_files` config to the equivalent task entries automatically, preserving your enable/disable state and tuning values.

- **`review-user-memories`** (was `user_memories`): set its `schedule` to enable, `""` to disable. Carries `promotion_threshold` (2–20, default 3). When scheduled, the historian extracts behavioral observations and this task promotes recurring patterns to stable user memories injected via `<user-profile>`. Privacy-sensitive — only runs when scheduled.
- **`key-files`** (was `pin_key_files`): set its `schedule` to enable (default off). Carries `token_budget` (2k–30k, default 10000) and `min_reads` (2–20, default 4). Requires AFT (see the Key files note at the top). Pins frequently-read files into a `<key-files>` block.

## History & Recall Features

> These four features graduated out of the old `experimental.*` namespace. `temporal_awareness` and `caveman_text_compression` are now top-level keys; `auto_search` and `git_commit_indexing` moved under `memory.*`. The `doctor` command relocates legacy `experimental.*` configs automatically and preserves any user-set values. **`temporal_awareness` and `memory.auto_search` are now ON by default** — set them `false` to opt out.

### `temporal_awareness`

| Key | Type | Default |
|-----|------|---------|
| `temporal_awareness` | `boolean` | `true` |

When enabled, Magic Context surfaces wall-clock time to the agent in two cache-safe ways:

1. **User-message gap markers.** Each user message is prefixed with an HTML comment like `<!-- +5m -->`, `<!-- +2h 15m -->`, or `<!-- +3d 4h -->` indicating time elapsed since the previous message's completion. Only shown when the gap exceeds 5 minutes. Derived from immutable `message.time.completed ?? message.time.created` timestamps.
2. **Compartment date ranges.** Each `<compartment>` element in `<session-history>` carries `start-date="YYYY-MM-DD"` and `end-date="YYYY-MM-DD"` attributes showing real-time boundaries.

Lets agents reason correctly about workflow pacing, log durations, build times, "how long ago" references, and session age. Without this flag the agent has no sense of time at all.

**Cache safety.** Markers are idempotent by regex detection and derive from static message timestamps — re-running the injector on any transform pass produces the same output, so enabling the flag busts cache once (on the first pass after flip) and then stays stable. Historian input is untouched.

### `memory.git_commit_indexing`

| Key | Type | Default |
|-----|------|---------|
| `memory.git_commit_indexing.enabled` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `memory.git_commit_indexing.since_days` | `number` | `365` |
| `memory.git_commit_indexing.max_commits` | `number` | `2000` |

Opt-in (default off; independent of `memory.enabled`). When enabled, Magic Context indexes HEAD git commits (skipping merges) from the project and makes them searchable through `ctx_search`. Commits are embedded using the configured embedding provider, so semantic search surfaces "when did we change the X pattern" or "why did we pick Y over Z" queries.

- **HEAD only, no merges.** Abandoned experiments on feature branches don't pollute search; merged work becomes reachable from HEAD anyway.
- **Windowed.** Only commits from the last `since_days` days are indexed (default 365). Older commits exit the window and are evicted when the project cap is exceeded.
- **Project-scoped.** Commits are stored per project identity (git root commit) so worktrees and clones share the same index.
- **Capped per project.** `max_commits` is a hard upper bound (default 2000). Oldest commits are evicted first when the cap is exceeded.
- **Non-blocking.** Initial sweep runs at startup; incremental tick runs every 15 minutes from the dream timer. The sweep skips already-indexed SHAs.
- **ctx_search integration.** Results appear as a `git_commit` source alongside `memory`, `session_fact`, and `message_history`. Each result carries the SHA, short SHA, author, and commit timestamp.

### `memory.auto_search`

| Key | Type | Default |
|-----|------|---------|
| `memory.auto_search.enabled` | `boolean` | `true` |
| `memory.auto_search.score_threshold` | `number` | `0.6` |
| `memory.auto_search.min_prompt_chars` | `number` | `20` |

On by default (independent of `memory.enabled` — it can still surface conversation/git hints with the memory store off; set `enabled: false` to opt out). Magic Context runs a background `ctx_search` on each new user message and, when a strong match is found, appends a compact "vague recall" hint to that user message. The hint surfaces highly compressed fragments from the best matches so the agent can decide whether to run `ctx_search` for the full content.

The hint looks like:

```xml
<ctx-search-hint>
Your memory may contain related context (3 related fragments):
- install.sh bunx --bun node stdin redirection
- magic-context fail closed durable storage unavailable
- commit abcd123 5d ago: install: force bun runtime in bunx invocation
Run ctx_search to retrieve full context if relevant.
</ctx-search-hint>
```

- **Memory fragments** are caveman-ultra compressed (stop words stripped, common verbs replaced) — dense keywords that mirror vague human recall.
- **Commit fragments** are the raw commit message (truncated, prefixed with `sha + relative age`) — commit messages are already compressed.
- **Session facts** use the same caveman-ultra compression as memories.

**Parameters:**

- `score_threshold`: minimum top-hit cosine score for the hint to fire (0.3–0.95, default 0.6). More permissive than direct injection because false-positive cost is small — the agent ignores irrelevant hints.
- `min_prompt_chars`: minimum user message length to trigger auto-search (default 20). Short prompts like "yes" or "ok" don't get a hint.

**Suppression rules.** The hint is not appended when:

1. `<ctx-search-hint>`, `<sidekick-augmentation>`, or `<ctx-search-auto>` is already present on the user message (avoids double-nudging when `/ctx-aug` was invoked).
2. The user message is shorter than `min_prompt_chars`.
3. No result clears the threshold.
4. An earlier pass already appended a hint for this message id (replayed verbatim on defer passes for cache safety).

**Cache safety.** The hint is appended to the current user message during the first transform pass of that turn — this message has not been cached by the provider yet because it just arrived. On subsequent defer passes the same hint text is replayed exactly (from a deterministic per-message cache), so the append is idempotent and never rewrites cached content.

**Tokens.** Hints are hard-capped at ~200 tokens (3 fragments × ~20-40 tokens each plus framing). Well under the cost of full-content injection (~500+ tokens), while still giving the agent enough signal to decide whether to search.

### `caveman_text_compression`

| Key | Type | Default |
|-----|------|---------|
| `caveman_text_compression.enabled` | `boolean` | `false` |
| `caveman_text_compression.min_chars` | `number` | `500` |

**Only active when `ctx_reduce_enabled: false`.** This is the opt-in successor to agent-driven text dropping for users who run without the `ctx_reduce` tool. When the flag is on, each execute-threshold heuristic pass caveman-compresses long user and assistant text parts in place based on their position in the eligible tag window.

**Age-tier partitioning.** Eligible tags (active, message-type, outside protected tail, text part ≥ `min_chars`) are sorted oldest-first and bucketed:

| Position (oldest → newest) | Target caveman level |
|---|---|
| Oldest 20 % | **Ultra** — symbol connectives (`→`, `+`, `//`, `\|`), common-term abbreviations |
| Next 20 % | **Full** — drop articles and most auxiliaries; fragments OK |
| Next 20 % | **Lite** — drop filler and hedging; keep grammar |
| Newest 40 % | Untouched |

Tier boundaries are hardcoded to keep behavior predictable and prevent cache-busting storms from user tweaking.

**Always compressed from the original.** The pristine pre-caveman text is persisted in `source_contents` per tag. When a tag shifts deeper (lite → full → ultra), caveman compresses the ORIGINAL text at the new target depth rather than the already-cavemaned intermediate, so repeated tier shifts converge to exactly the same output as direct compression at the final depth.

**Cache safety.** Runs only on execute-threshold heuristic passes (same gate as automatic tool drops), so the single cache-busting pass materializes both tool drops and caveman compression together. Defer passes don't run caveman, and tier assignments are persisted in `tags.caveman_depth` so the next pass re-compresses only the tags that have shifted tiers.

**What it replaces.** With `ctx_reduce` on, agents can manually drop user/assistant text parts when they judge the content is no longer needed. With `ctx_reduce: false`, agents can't do that — this heuristic fills the gap by automatically aging long text toward ever-denser caveman compression. Tool drops and reasoning clearing still handle their own content regardless.

**When to enable.** Enable alongside `ctx_reduce_enabled: false` if you find historian/heuristics insufficient for your workload — typically sessions with very long pasted content or verbose agent explanations that the automatic pipeline doesn't reach. Leaves `ctx_reduce_enabled: true` sessions untouched.

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ctx-status` | Show current context usage, tag counts, pending queue, nudge state, and history compression info. |
| `/ctx-flush` | Force-execute all pending operations and heuristic cleanup immediately. |
| `/ctx-recomp` | Rebuild all compartments and facts from raw session history. Resumable across restarts. |
| `/ctx-recomp <start>-<end>` | Partial rebuild of a message range (e.g. `/ctx-recomp 1-11322`). Snaps to enclosing compartment boundaries, rebuilds only those compartments using current historian rules, and leaves prior/tail compartments and all session facts untouched. Useful after upgrading historian prompt versions or model quality. Resumable across restarts; running with a different range while partial-recomp staging exists is rejected. Currently Desktop/Web-only (TUI falls back to full-recomp dialog; ranged TUI dialog is planned). |
| `/ctx-dream` | Enqueue the current project for a dream run and process immediately. |
| `/ctx-aug` | Run sidekick augmentation on the provided prompt. |
