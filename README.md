## What is Magic Context?

Your agent **should never stop working** to manage its own context. Magic Context is an OpenCode plugin that handles context and memory management entirely in the background:

**1.** Transparent context compaction via a **background historian** — the main agent keeps working while a separate model compresses older conversation. All operations are **cache-aware** and deferred to avoid wasting cached prefixes.

**2.** **Cross-session project memory** — architecture decisions, constraints, and preferences persist across conversations.

**3.** Overnight dreamer agent that consolidates, deduplicates, and promotes memories into canonical facts, plus maintains codebase documentation.

**4.** On-demand sidekick that augments prompts with relevant project context.

**5.** TUI sidebar with live context breakdown, token usage, historian status, and memory counts — right inside the terminal.

## Best way to use Magic Context?  

Keep using the **same session** for **weeks**, **months**, or even **years**. **One session** per **project**!

---

### ✨ Recent Highlights

**Subagents now self-manage context (v0.15)** — subagent sessions now run age-based tool drops, reasoning clearing, and structural stripping at the execute threshold — the same way primary sessions with `ctx_reduce_enabled: false` behave. Previously they had no automatic reduction and grew silently until overflow. Nudges, historian/compartment runs, and the `<session-history>` block remain primary-only — subagents stay lean and parent-driven.

**Lean sessions when `ctx_reduce_enabled: false` (v0.15)** — when you opt out of agent-driven reduction, the `§N§` tag prefix on user/assistant text and tool output is no longer injected, saving several thousand tokens per long session. The injected prompt guidance also switches to the no-reduce variant so the agent isn't told about a tool it can't use. DB tag records still exist (heuristic cleanup, persistence, and replay all depend on them); only the agent-visible prefix is skipped.

**User Memories (v0.14)** — enabled by default under `dreamer.user_memories`. Historian extracts behavioral observations about you alongside its normal compartment output (communication style, expertise level, review focus, working patterns). Recurring observations are promoted by the dreamer to stable user memories that appear in all sessions via `<user-profile>`. Set `dreamer.user_memories.enabled: false` to opt out. Requires dreamer.

**Key File Pinning (v0.14)** — under `dreamer.pin_key_files`, still opt-in. Dreamer analyzes which files your agent reads most frequently across the session. Core orientation files (architecture, config, types) that get re-read after every context drop are pinned into the system prompt as `<key-files>`, so the agent always has them without needing to re-read from disk. Files are read fresh on each cache-busting pass. Enable with `dreamer.pin_key_files.enabled: true`.

> Migrating from an earlier version? Running `npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor` rewrites old `experimental.user_memories.*` and `experimental.pin_key_files.*` keys into their new `dreamer.*` homes, preserving any `enabled` state you had.

### 🧪 New Experimental Features

**Age-tier caveman text compression (v0.15)** — opt-in companion to `ctx_reduce_enabled: false`. Older user/assistant text parts are progressively compressed using deterministic [caveman rules](https://github.com/cortexkit/magic-context/blob/master/packages/plugin/src/hooks/magic-context/caveman.ts) — the oldest 20% go to ultra-compressed, next 20% to full, next 20% to lite, newest 40% untouched. Tier shifts always recompress from the pristine original, never from an already-cavemaned intermediate, so the result is stable across passes. Cache-safe by design. Enable with `experimental.caveman_text_compression: { enabled: true }`. Only active when `ctx_reduce_enabled: false`.

**Temporal Awareness** — gives the agent real-time perception. Each user message gets a small `<!-- +5m -->`/`<!-- +2h 15m -->`/`<!-- +3d 4h -->` gap marker showing time since the previous message, and every compartment in `<session-history>` carries `start-date`/`end-date` attributes. Lets the agent reason correctly about how long a build ran, when a decision was made, or how stale a prior session is. Cache-safe — markers derive from immutable timestamps. Enable with `experimental.temporal_awareness: true`.

**Git Commit Indexing** — indexes HEAD git commits (skipping merges) from the project and makes them searchable through `ctx_search`. Commits are embedded so semantic queries like "when did we change the auth pattern" or "why did we pick X over Y" surface the right work. HEAD-only, windowed to the last year by default, capped at 2000 commits per project with oldest evicted. Enable with `experimental.git_commit_indexing.enabled: true`.

**Auto Search Hints** — before each turn, Magic Context runs a background `ctx_search` on your prompt. When highly relevant content exists, a compact "vague recall" hint is appended to your message with caveman-compressed fragments of the top matches — like a human feeling they almost remember something and going to check their notes. The agent then decides whether to run `ctx_search` for the full content. Cache-safe, fires on top-score ≥ 0.55 by default. Enable with `experimental.auto_search.enabled: true`.

## Get Started

### Quick Setup (Recommended)

Run the interactive setup wizard — it detects your models, configures everything, and handles compatibility:

**macOS / Linux:**
```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cortexkit/magic-context/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cortexkit/magic-context/master/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

**Or run directly (any OS):**
```bash
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest setup
```

The unified setup wizard auto-detects which harnesses you have installed (OpenCode, Pi, or both) and configures each one. Use `--harness opencode` or `--harness pi` to target a specific harness.

The wizard will:
1. Detect installed harnesses and available models
2. Add the plugin and disable built-in compaction
3. Help you pick models for historian, dreamer, and sidekick
4. Handle oh-my-opencode compatibility if needed

### Manual Setup

Add to your OpenCode config (`opencode.json` or `opencode.jsonc`):

```jsonc
{
  "plugin": ["@cortexkit/opencode-magic-context"],
  "compaction": {
    "auto": false,
    "prune": false
  }
}
```

> **Why disable compaction?** Magic Context manages context itself — built-in compaction interferes with its cache-aware deferred operations and would cause duplicate compression.

Create `magic-context.jsonc` in your project root, `.opencode/`, or `~/.config/opencode/`:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/cortexkit/magic-context/master/assets/magic-context.schema.json",
  "enabled": true,

  // Which model the historian uses for background compression, 
  // Prefer providers that charge by request instead of tokens
  "historian": {
    "model": "github-copilot/gpt-5.4",
    "fallback_models": ["opencode-go/glm-5"]
  }
}
```

> **Tip:** The `$schema` key enables autocomplete and validation in VS Code and other editors.

That's it. Everything else has sensible defaults. Project config merges on top of user-wide settings; `auto_update` is user-config-only so projects cannot disable plugin self-updates.

### Oh-My-OpenCode / Oh-My-OpenAgent Users

If you use [oh-my-openagent](https://github.com/code-yeongyu/oh-my-openagent) (formerly oh-my-opencode), disable the hooks that conflict with Magic Context in your `oh-my-openagent.json`:

```json
{
  "disabled_hooks": [
    "context-window-monitor",
    "preemptive-compaction",
    "anthropic-context-window-limit-recovery"
  ]
}
```

The setup wizard handles this automatically if it detects an oh-my-openagent or oh-my-opencode config.

### Doctor (Troubleshooting)

Already installed but something isn't working? Run the doctor to check and auto-fix configuration issues:

```bash
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor
```

Doctor auto-detects installed harnesses and runs the right checks for each. Pass `--harness opencode` or `--harness pi` to target a specific harness when you have both installed.

Doctor checks for conflicts (compaction, DCP, OMO hooks), ensures the TUI sidebar is configured (OpenCode), verifies the plugin is registered, validates the magic-context.jsonc, runs `PRAGMA integrity_check` on the shared SQLite DB, and checks the npm cache — fixing what it can automatically. The summary line reports `PASS X / WARN Y / FAIL Z` so you can scan results at a glance.

Use `--force` to force-clear the plugin cache even when versions match (fixes broken transitive dependencies):

```bash
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor --force
```

Hit a real bug? Use `--issue` to collect environment, sanitized config, and the last 400 log lines into a ready-to-submit report. It can also open the issue directly via `gh` if you have it installed:

```bash
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor --issue
```

---

## Pi coding agent (beta)

Magic Context is also available as a [Pi](https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono) extension, sharing the **same SQLite database** as the OpenCode plugin. Project memories, embeddings, dreamer state, and key-file pins are pooled across both harnesses; per-session state (tags, compartments, facts, notes) stays harness-scoped.

> ⚠️ The Pi extension is published as **beta** while it accumulates real-world usage. Core flows are validated with end-to-end tests; report issues at [github.com/cortexkit/magic-context/issues](https://github.com/cortexkit/magic-context/issues).

```bash
# Setup wizard for Pi (uses the same unified CLI as OpenCode)
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest setup --harness pi
```

Requires Pi `>= 0.71.0`. The wizard handles registration with Pi (`packages` array in `~/.pi/agent/settings.json`), writes `~/.pi/agent/magic-context.jsonc`, and prompts for historian/dreamer/sidekick model picks. Pi-specific docs and config notes live in [`packages/pi-plugin/README.md`](https://github.com/cortexkit/magic-context/blob/master/packages/pi-plugin/README.md).

For health checks:

```bash
npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor --harness pi
```

---

## What Your Agent Gets

Magic Context injects structured context automatically and gives the agent five tools.

### `ctx_reduce` — Shed weight

After tool-heavy turns (large grep results, file reads, bash output), the agent calls `ctx_reduce` to mark stale content for removal. Drops are queued — not applied immediately — until the cache expires or context pressure forces it.

```
ctx_reduce(drop="3-5,12")     // Drop tags 3, 4, 5, and 12
```

Recent tags (last 20 by default) are protected. Drops targeting them stay queued until they age out.

### `ctx_expand` — Decompress history

When the agent needs to recall details from a compressed history range, it can expand specific compartment ranges back to the original conversation transcript.

```
ctx_expand(start=100, end=200)   // Expand raw messages 100-200
```

Returns the same compact `U:`/`A:` transcript format the historian sees, capped at ~15K tokens per request. Use `start`/`end` from compartment attributes visible in `<session-history>`.

### `ctx_note` — Deferred intentions

Session notes are the agent's scratchpad for things to tackle later — not task tracking (that's what todos are for), but deferred work and reminders that should surface at the right time.

```
ctx_note(action="write", content="After this fix, check if the compressor budget formula is correct")
ctx_note(action="read")
```

Notes surface automatically at natural work boundaries: after commits, after historian runs, and after all todos complete.

**Smart notes** are project-scoped notes with an open-ended `surface_condition` that the dreamer evaluates nightly. When the condition is met, the note surfaces in the next session:

```
ctx_note(action="write", content="Implement X because Y", surface_condition="When PR #42 is merged in this repo")
ctx_note(action="dismiss", note_id=1)
```

Smart notes require dreamer enabled. Pending notes are invisible until the dreamer marks them ready. Use `dismiss` to clear a surfaced note.

### `ctx_memory` — Persistent cross-session knowledge

Architecture decisions, naming conventions, user preferences — anything that should survive across conversations. Memories are project-scoped and automatically promoted from session facts by the historian.

```
ctx_memory(action="write", category="ARCHITECTURE_DECISIONS", content="Event sourcing for orders.")
ctx_memory(action="delete", id=42)
```

### `ctx_search` — Unified search

Search across all data layers with a single query — project memories, session facts, and raw conversation history. Results are ranked by source (memories first, then facts, then message hits).

```
ctx_search(query="authentication approach")
```

Message results include ordinal numbers the agent can pass to `ctx_expand` to retrieve the surrounding conversation context.

### Automatic context injection

Every turn, Magic Context injects a `<session-history>` block containing:

- **Project memories** — cross-session decisions, constraints, and preferences
- **Compartments** — structured summaries replacing older raw history
- **Session facts** — durable categorized facts from the current session

This block is stable between historian runs. Memory writes persist immediately for search but don't change the injected block until the next historian run — so writes never bust the cache mid-conversation.

---

## How It Works

### Tagging

Every message, tool output, and file attachment gets a monotonically increasing `§N§` tag. The agent sees these inline and uses them to reference specific content when calling `ctx_reduce`. Tags persist in the database and resume across restarts.

### Queued reductions

When the agent calls `ctx_reduce`, drops go into a pending queue — not applied immediately. Two conditions trigger execution:

- **Cache expired** — enough time has passed that the cached prefix is likely stale (configurable per model, default 5 minutes)
- **Threshold reached** — context usage hits `execute_threshold_percentage` (default 65%)

Between triggers, the conversation continues unchanged. The agent doesn't need to think about timing.

### Background historian

When local drops aren't buying enough headroom, Magic Context starts a historian — a separate lightweight model that reads an eligible prefix of raw history and produces:

- **Compartments** — chronological blocks that replace older raw messages
- **Facts** — durable decisions, constraints, and preferences (categorized)

The historian runs asynchronously. The main agent never waits for it. When the historian finishes, its output is materialized on the next transform pass.

A **separate compressor** pass fires when the rendered history block exceeds the configured history budget, merging the oldest compartments to keep the injected context lean.

### Nudging

As context usage grows, Magic Context sends rolling reminders suggesting the agent reduce. Cadence tightens as usage approaches the threshold — from gentle reminders to urgent warnings. If the agent recently called `ctx_reduce`, reminders are suppressed. At 85% Magic Context force-materializes queued drops and emergency cleanup; at 95% it blocks the turn until background historian completes.

### Cross-session memory

After each historian run, qualifying facts are promoted to the persistent memory store. On every subsequent turn, active memories are injected in `<session-history>`. New sessions inherit all project memories from previous sessions.

Memories are searchable via `ctx_search` alongside session facts and raw conversation history, using semantic embeddings (local by default) with full-text search as fallback.

### Dreamer

An optional background agent that maintains memory quality overnight:

- **Consolidate** — merge semantically similar memories into canonical facts
- **Verify** — check memories against current codebase (configs, paths, code patterns)
- **Archive stale** — retire memories referencing removed features or old paths
- **Improve** — rewrite verbose memories into terse operational form
- **Maintain docs** — update ARCHITECTURE.md and STRUCTURE.md from codebase changes
- **Evaluate smart notes** — check pending smart note conditions and surface ready notes
- **Review user memories** — promote recurring user behavior observations to stable memories

The dreamer runs during a configurable schedule window and creates ephemeral OpenCode child sessions for each task. Since it runs during idle time (typically overnight), it works well with local models — even slower ones like `ollama/mlx-qwen3.5-27b-claude-4.6-opus-reasoning-distilled` are fine since there's no user waiting.

When dreamer is enabled, ARCHITECTURE.md and STRUCTURE.md are automatically injected into the agent's system prompt (configurable via `inject_docs`). Content is cached per-session and refreshed on cache-busting passes.

### User Memories

Enabled by default under `dreamer.user_memories`. Historian extracts behavioral observations about the user alongside its normal compartment output — things like communication style, expertise level, review focus, and working patterns. These go into a candidate pool.

During dreamer runs, a dedicated review pass checks candidates for recurring patterns across sessions. Observations that appear at least `promotion_threshold` times (default 3) are promoted to stable user memories and injected into all sessions via `<user-profile>` in the system prompt.

Stable user memories are visible and manageable in the dashboard's User Memories page. Requires dreamer to be enabled for the promotion step — without dreamer, candidates accumulate but are never promoted. Set `dreamer.user_memories.enabled: false` to opt out.

### TUI Sidebar

When running in OpenCode's terminal UI, Magic Context shows a live sidebar panel with:

- **Context breakdown bar** — visual token split across System Prompt, Compartments, Facts, Memories, Conversation, Tool Calls, Tool Definitions (measured from the `tool.definition` hook), and Overhead. Cool palette for structured injections, warm palette for user/tool traffic.
- **Historian status** — idle, running, or compartment/fact counts
- **Memory counts** — total project memories and how many are injected
- **Dreamer status** — last run time
- **Queue status** — pending operations count

The sidebar updates after every message. Commands (`/ctx-status`, `/ctx-flush`, `/ctx-aug`) also work directly in TUI mode via dialogs and toasts.

The TUI plugin is configured automatically by the setup wizard and the `doctor` command. If you installed manually, add to your `tui.json` or `tui.jsonc`:

```jsonc
{
  "plugin": ["@cortexkit/opencode-magic-context"]
}
```

### Startup conflict detection

On startup, Magic Context checks for common configuration problems — OpenCode's built-in compaction being enabled, DCP plugin being active alongside Magic Context, or conflicting oh-my-openagent hooks. When conflicts are detected, it warns the active session with a fix suggestion pointing to `npx @cortexkit/magic-context@latest doctor`.

---

## Commands

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/ctx-status` | Debug view: tags, pending drops, cache TTL, nudge state, historian progress, compartment coverage, history compression budget |
| `/ctx-flush` | Force all queued operations immediately, bypassing cache TTL |
| `/ctx-recomp` | Rebuild compartments and facts from raw history — use when stored state seems wrong |

---

## Magic Context App

A companion desktop app for browsing and managing Magic Context state outside of OpenCode.

<p align="center">
   <a href="https://github.com/cortexkit/magic-context/releases/tag/dashboard-v0.4.7"><strong>⬇️ Download for macOS · Windows · Linux</strong></a></p>

**Features:**
- **Memory Browser** — search, filter, and edit project memories with category and project filtering
- **Session History** — browse compartments, facts, and notes for any session with timeline navigation
- **Cache Diagnostics** — real-time cache hit/miss timeline, bust cause detection, per-session stats
- **Dreamer Management** — view dream run history per project, trigger runs, inspect task results
- **Configuration Editor** — form-based editing for all settings including model selection with fallback chains
- **Log Viewer** — live-tailing log viewer with search
- **System Tray** — quick access to dreamer status and controls

The app reads directly from Magic Context's SQLite database — no additional server or API required. Auto-updates are built in.

---

## Configuration

All settings live in `magic-context.jsonc` as flat top-level keys. See **[CONFIGURATION.md](./CONFIGURATION.md)** for the full reference — cache TTL tuning, per-model execute thresholds, historian model selection, embedding providers, memory settings, sidekick, and dreamer.

**Config locations** (merged in order, project overrides user):
1. `<project-root>/magic-context.jsonc`
2. `<project-root>/.opencode/magic-context.jsonc`
3. `~/.config/opencode/magic-context.jsonc`

---

## Storage

All durable states live in a local SQLite database. If the database can't be opened, Magic Context disables itself and notifies the user.

```
~/.local/share/opencode/storage/plugin/magic-context/context.db
```

## Development

**Requirements:** [Bun](https://bun.sh) ≥ 1.0

```sh
bun install              # Install dependencies
bun run build            # Build the plugin
bun run typecheck        # Type-check without emitting
bun test                 # Run tests
bun run lint             # Lint (Biome)
bun run lint:fix         # Lint with auto-fix
bun run format           # Format (Biome)
```

**Utility scripts:**

```sh
bun packages/plugin/scripts/tail-view.ts             # Show post-compartment message tail
bun packages/plugin/scripts/context-dump/index.ts     # Dump full context state for a session
bun packages/plugin/scripts/backfill-embeddings.ts   # Backfill missing memory embeddings
```

Dream execution requires a live OpenCode server — the dreamer creates ephemeral child sessions. Use `/ctx-dream` inside OpenCode for on-demand maintenance.
