 * Plugin-private localhost RPC server for TUI ↔ server-plugin communication.
 *
 * Runs on Bun (the OpenCode server runner is a Bun Worker), so it uses
 * `Bun.serve` to host BOTH:
 *  - HTTP request/reply routes (`/health`, `/rpc/<method>`) — the TUI's snapshot
 *    and dialog-result calls, which are event-driven, not idle; and
 *  - a WebSocket endpoint (`/ws`) — a single persistent connection per TUI over
 *    which the server PUSHES notifications (dialog/toast actions). This replaces
 *    the old 500ms HTTP poll, whose new-connection-per-tick cost was the source
 *    of idle TUI CPU (#200). Pi never imports this module, so `Bun.serve` is safe.
