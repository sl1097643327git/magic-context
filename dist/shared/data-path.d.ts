 * Per-harness scratch directory under the OS temp dir.
 *
 * Layout:
 *   - OpenCode: `${os.tmpdir()}/opencode/magic-context/`
 *   - Pi:       `${os.tmpdir()}/pi/magic-context/`
 *
 * Why a per-harness subtree of `os.tmpdir()`:
 *   1. OpenCode Desktop runs as an Electron app with a permission sandbox.
 *      Writing to arbitrary tmp paths can trigger user-visible permission
 *      prompts; the `${tmpdir}/opencode/` subtree is allow-listed by
 *      OpenCode, so anything we put under it never asks for permission.
 *   2. Splitting OpenCode from Pi keeps their logs and historian dump
 *      directories cleanly separated. `doctor --issue` for each harness
 *      reports diagnostics from the matching subtree, so an OpenCode
 *      issue report never includes Pi log noise (and vice versa).
 *   3. Pi has no permission sandbox, so the path choice is purely
 *      cosmetic for Pi — it just keeps the layout symmetric.
 *
 * Pass an explicit `harness` only when the caller already knows the
 * harness without relying on the global `setHarness()` state (e.g. the
 * CLI's doctor commands, which target a specific harness regardless of
 * which plugin is loaded). Production runtime callers should omit it so
 * the helper picks up the boot-time harness automatically.

 * caching, so `setHarness("pi")` taking effect after module load is
 * reflected in the next flush.

 * and that the model is asked to read via its native Read tool. OpenCode's
 * `external_directory` permission system asks the user before reading any
 * file outside the project directory or its worktree, which interrupts every
 * historian run when artifacts live under `os.tmpdir()`. Writing under the
 * project's own `.cortexkit/` subtree falls inside the project boundary and
 * never triggers a permission prompt.
 *
 * `.cortexkit/` is the shared CortexKit per-project dir (also holds the
 * project config `magic-context.jsonc`). Because these artifacts are transient
 * debug dumps that shouldn't dirty the user's repo, the first write also drops
 * a fenced-block `.gitignore` entry ignoring this subdir (see
 * ensureCortexKitArtifactGitignore) while leaving `*.jsonc` config tracked.
 *
 * Migration note: artifacts used to live under `.opencode/magic-context/`. We
 * cut the write path forward only — old transient dumps are git-ignored and
 * regenerated, so they are intentionally NOT migrated (left to be cleaned).
 *
 * Logger does NOT use this — log files stay in the per-harness tmp subtree
 * because they are written by the plugin process itself (no model-side Read
 * tool call, no permission prompt) and span sessions/projects.

 *
 * Uses the shared CortexKit fenced-block convention: each module owns exactly
 * its `# >>> cortexkit:<module>` … `# <<< cortexkit:<module>` block and appends
