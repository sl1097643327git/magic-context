/**
 * SQLite chokepoint — runtime-detected backend selection.
 *
 * The same shipped plugin artifact must run under two different runtimes:
 *   - Bun (current OpenCode releases) → uses `bun:sqlite` (built-in, fast)
 *   - Node / Electron (Pi plugin, OpenCode Desktop) → uses `node:sqlite`
 *     (`DatabaseSync`, built into Node 22.5+ / Electron 41+, stable-enough and
 *     flag-free since Node 22.13/23.4).
 *
 * Bun has no `node:sqlite`, and Node/Electron have no `bun:sqlite`. Static
 * imports of either would crash at parse time in the wrong runtime, so we use
 * dynamic imports gated by runtime detection.
 *
 * Why `node:sqlite` instead of `better-sqlite3`: better-sqlite3 is a native
 * module requiring per-ABI prebuilds, and Electron's ABI never matches the npm
 * Node prebuild — which forced a runtime download of an Electron-matched
 * `.node` binary (a supply-chain + maintenance liability). `node:sqlite` is
 * built into the runtime, so there is NOTHING to download or rebuild. Both Pi
 * (plain Node 24) and OpenCode Desktop (Electron 41 → Node 24.14.1) ship it.
 *
 * API surface we use (common across both backends, modulo the shims below):
 *   - new Database(path, { readonly?: boolean })   ← we map readonly→readOnly
 *   - db.prepare(sql).run/get/all
 *   - db.exec(multistatement)
 *   - db.transaction(fn) → wrapped function        ← shimmed for node:sqlite
 *   - db.close()
 *
 * The three backend differences we bridge for node:sqlite:
 *   1. node:sqlite has no `db.transaction(fn)` helper — we add a savepoint-aware
 *      shim (below) that matches better-sqlite3/bun semantics.
 *   2. node:sqlite's constructor option is `readOnly` (camel-case), not
 *      better-sqlite3/bun's `readonly` — we translate it so call sites are
 *      unchanged.
 *   3. node:sqlite reads a lone array bind arg (`.run([a,b])`) as NAMED params
 *      and throws `Unknown named parameter '0'`; bun binds it positionally. We
 *      normalize it in the `prepare()` override (below) so the bind surface is
 *      identical (issue #151 / Pi /ctx-dream).
 * Everything else (named params with bare keys, ATTACH under defensive mode,
 * `run()` → {changes,lastInsertRowid}) is identical and was verified directly.
