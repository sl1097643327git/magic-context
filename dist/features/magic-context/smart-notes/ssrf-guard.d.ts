/**
 * A `net.LookupFunction`-shaped hook that always resolves to the single
 * pre-validated, pinned IP — never re-querying DNS (anti-rebinding). Node may
 * invoke it with `{ all: true }` (Happy-Eyeballs / autoSelectFamily), which
 * expects the ARRAY callback form, or with the legacy single-address form. We
 * honor both: returning the wrong shape made Node's lookupAndConnectMultiple
 * call `results.sort(...)` on `undefined`, which surfaced as
 * "SMART_NOTE_NETWORK: results.sort is not a function" and broke every
 * network-touching smart-note check.
 *
 * Node's `LookupFunction` type only models the legacy 3-arg callback, so the
 * dual-shape dispatch is expressed against a locally-widened callback type and
 * the result is asserted back to `LookupFunction` for `https.request`.
