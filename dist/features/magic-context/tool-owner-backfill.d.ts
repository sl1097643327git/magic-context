/**
 * Tool-owner backfill (plan v3.3.1, Layer B).
 *
 * Migration v10 added `tool_owner_message_id` to the tags table. The
 * runtime carries every new tool tag with a non-NULL owner, but the
 * 185k+ existing rows in user DBs need their owner column populated to
 * make the v10 fix fully effective. The backfill pass iterates each
 * session that has tool tags with NULL owner, queries the OpenCode DB
 * for the temporally-earliest assistant message that invoked each
 * callID, and writes the owner via a NULL-guarded UPDATE so the
 * runtime can lazily adopt rows the backfill couldn't see (e.g. Pi
 * sessions, deleted OC sessions, transient OC-DB-unavailable cases).
 *
 * Concurrency model:
 *   - Per-session advisory lease via `tool_owner_backfill_state`.
 *   - 5-minute lease, renewed every 60s during chunked execution.
 *   - Sibling instances skip sessions whose lease is held and active.
 *   - Process-death cleanup falls out for free: better-sqlite3 + WAL
 *     drops all locks at process exit, and the `lease_expires_at`
 *     column is the only durable state. A crashed process's session
 *     becomes claimable as soon as the lease wall-clock expires.
 *   - NULL-guarded UPDATE: backfill never clobbers a row already
 *     adopted at runtime.
 *
 * Skip vs fail semantics:
 *   - When OpenCode DB is missing (e.g. Pi-only install), every
 *     session gets marked 'skipped' in the state table. Lazy adoption
 *     handles the orphans at runtime.
 *   - When OpenCode DB exists but a specific session is missing or
 *     yields zero matches, that session is marked 'skipped' too.
 *     Same lazy-adoption fallback covers it.
 *   - A session error during backfill (SQLITE_BUSY, malformed JSON,
 *     anything) is logged and the session is left in 'pending'/
 *     'running' for a retry on next plugin start. Backfill never
 *     fail-closes the plugin — it's defense-in-depth on top of
 *     Layer C lazy adoption.
 *
 * Idempotency:
 *   - The NULL guard makes UPDATE idempotent: re-running against an
 *     already-backfilled row matches zero rows and moves on.
 *   - The state table makes session bookkeeping idempotent: a
 *     completed session is never re-processed; a session with unresolved
 *     NULL-owner rows stays pending for later lazy adoption/retry.
