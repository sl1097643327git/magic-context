/**
 * Provider-agnostic context-overflow error detection.
 *
 * When a provider rejects a request because the prompt exceeds its context
 * window, we want to react:
 *   1. Trigger emergency recovery (historian + aggressive drops) so the next
 *      turn fits.
 *   2. If the error message reveals the real context limit, persist it as a
 *      session-specific override so pressure math is accurate going forward.
 *
 * Pattern list adapted from OpenCode's `packages/opencode/src/provider/error.ts`
 * (BSD-licensed). We keep our own copy rather than importing OpenCode internals
 * so the plugin stays decoupled from OpenCode versioning.
 *
 * References:
 *   - OpenCode overflow detection (origin of patterns):
 *     https://github.com/sst/opencode/blob/main/packages/opencode/src/provider/error.ts
 *   - Adapted originally from:
 *     https://github.com/earendil-works/pi-mono/blob/main/packages/ai/src/utils/overflow.ts
