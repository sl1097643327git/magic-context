/**
 * Extract high-signal literal tokens ("probes") from a search query.
 *
 * Why this exists: `sanitizeFtsQuery` AND-joins every token, so a long natural-
 * language query like "why did ctx-status tool calls inflate" only matches a
 * message that contains ALL those words. A message that contains the literal
 * symbol `/ctx-status` but not the other six words is never retrieved — pure
 * recall loss, unfixable by ranking. Running each literal probe as its OWN FTS
 * query (in addition to the full query) recovers those candidates.
 *
 * Tuned for a PROSE / CONVERSATION corpus (memories + raw chat + commit
 * messages), NOT code: we look for the symbol/command/path/identifier shapes
 * that appear verbatim in conversation and that a paraphrased NL query would
 * otherwise drown. Plain prose yields zero probes, so NL queries are unaffected.
