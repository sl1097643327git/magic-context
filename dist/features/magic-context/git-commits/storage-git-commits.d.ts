/**
 * SQLite storage layer for indexed git commits.
 *
 * Separate from the memory embedding table because:
 *   - Identity is the SHA, not a memory row id
 *   - Lifecycle is managed by git, not by Dreamer review flow
 *   - FTS is also separate so commit queries never pollute memory BM25 ranks
 *
 * Eviction: when `max_commits` is exceeded for a project, we delete the oldest
 * commits by `committed_at ASC` (not by indexed_at — indexed_at can reorder
 * when we catch up after a long absence). ON DELETE CASCADE removes matching
 * embedding rows and FTS triggers remove matching FTS rows, so a single DELETE
 * cleans all three tables.
