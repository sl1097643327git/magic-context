 * Whether the model an endpoint served is the model we asked for.

 * Exact match after trim+lowercase, with TOKEN-BOUNDARY prefix/suffix tolerance
 * so a server that version-expands a name (`text-embedding-3-small` →
 * `…-small-v1`) or trims a vendor prefix (`openai/text-embedding-3-small` →
 * `text-embedding-3-small`) still counts as a match.
 *
 * Crucially this is NOT a plain substring test. A loose `a.includes(b)` would
 * MATCH a broadly-configured name against an unrelated served model that merely
 * contains it as a middle token — e.g. configured `qwen3-embedding`, served
 * `text-embedding-qwen3-embedding-0.6b` → store 0.6b vectors under the broad
 * identity (wrong-dim corruption, the exact failure this guard exists to stop).
 * So the shorter name must align on a `-`/`/` boundary as a genuine PREFIX or
 * SUFFIX of the longer, never as an interior fragment.
