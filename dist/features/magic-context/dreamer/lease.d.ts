 * We declare the lease lost (and call onLost ONCE) only when:

 *     can't reclaim it (acquireLease reclaims an expired-but-free lease, so a
 *     self-inflicted expiry from our own delayed beat recovers instead of
 *     killing the run); or
 *   - a full TTL has elapsed with no confirmed renewal (only reachable via
 *     repeated transient throws), past which exclusive ownership can't be
 *     guaranteed.
 * A transient throw with a recent successful renewal is swallowed and retried on
 * the next beat.
