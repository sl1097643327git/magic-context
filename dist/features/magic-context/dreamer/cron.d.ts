/**
 * Minimal 5-field cron evaluator for per-task dreamer scheduling.
 *
 * Why vendored (no dependency): we only need "next occurrence after time T", the
 * 3-day package-release-age floor makes pulling a dep awkward, and the surface is
 * small. Shared core — both OpenCode and Pi import this via @magic-context/core.
 *
 * Fields: `minute hour day-of-month month day-of-week`
 *   minute 0-59 · hour 0-23 · dom 1-31 · month 1-12 · dow 0-6 (0 or 7 = Sunday)
 * Each field supports: a star wildcard, a star-with-step (every-N), a single
 * value `a`, a range `a-b`, a range-with-step `a-b/step`, an open step `a/step`
 * (a..max), and comma-lists of any of those. Numeric only — month and weekday
 * NAMES are intentionally unsupported (smaller surface; add later if asked).
 * Empty string `""` means "never" and is handled by the caller, not here.
 *
 * Day matching uses Vixie OR-semantics: when BOTH dom and dow are restricted
 * (not `*`), a day matches if EITHER matches; when only one is restricted, only
 * that one is consulted; when neither is restricted, every day matches.
 *
 * Timezone: all matching is in the machine's LOCAL time — the dreamer's whole
 * purpose is "run while the user is asleep", which is a wall-clock concept.
 * nextOccurrence steps by real (epoch) minutes and reads LOCAL civil fields off
 * each candidate, so DST transitions are handled correctly by construction (no
 * setHours/local-constructor normalization, which is DST-ambiguous).
