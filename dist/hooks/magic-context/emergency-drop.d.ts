 * fixedFloor is derived as `currentTotalInputTokens − Σ(active floor-tag tokens)`.
 * Tags cover exactly the live-tail content (messages, tool outputs, files,
 * reasoning); system, tool defs, and m[0]/m[1] are untagged. So this difference
 * IS `system + toolDefs + (primary ? m0 + m1 : 0)` — the irreducible prefix —
 * with no extra plumbing, and it self-adjusts for subagents (no m0/m1 in their
 * total) by construction.
 *
 * The two tag sets serve DIFFERENT contracts and must not be conflated:
 * - `floorTags`: the ENTIRE active live-window tag set (all types, including
 *   non-droppable tool tags). Only their token sum matters — it makes
 *   `fixedFloor` the true irreducible prefix. Passing a narrower set (e.g.
 *   tool-only) folds real conversation/reasoning tail into the "floor",
 *   raising the target and systematically under-evicting at ≥85%.
 * - `tags`: the evictable candidates — active tool tags whose drop target
 *   would actually reclaim bytes (caller pre-filters on `canDrop()` so no
 *   phantom tag is counted as reclaimed).
