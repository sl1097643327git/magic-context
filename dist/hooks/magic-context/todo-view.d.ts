/**
 * Todo state synthesis — synthetic todowrite injection.
 *
 * Instead of inventing a custom `<current-todos>` block (which agents would
 * need to learn to parse), we synthesize a realistic `todowrite` tool part
 * and inject it into the latest assistant message on cache-busting passes.
 * The agent reads it through their existing todowrite-tracking mental model:
 * the wire shape is identical to OpenCode's stored todowrite tool parts
 * (`{type: "tool", callID, tool: "todowrite", state: {input, output, ...}}`).
 *
 * Cache safety:
 *   - Snapshot capture (in hook-handlers.ts on tool.execute.after) writes DB
 *     only — no message mutation.
 *   - Injection happens in transform-postprocess-phase.ts AFTER tagging and
 *     AFTER applyPendingOperations, so the synthetic part never gets tagged
 *     and is invisible to ctx_reduce and heuristic cleanup.
 *   - The synthetic callID is deterministic (sha256(stateJson)) so a stable
 *     snapshot produces a stable wire shape across passes; on defer passes we
 *     re-inject the same part at the same anchor, idempotent via callID match.
 *
 * Wire shape verified against:
 *   - OpenCode source: ~/Work/OSS/opencode/packages/opencode/src/tool/todo.ts
 *   - Production OpenCode DB sample: part where data LIKE '%"tool":"todowrite"%'
