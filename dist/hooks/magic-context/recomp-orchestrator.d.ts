/**
 * Single source of truth for recomp + session-upgrade orchestration.
 *
 * Before this module there were THREE diverged implementations — the RPC
 * `recomp` handler, the RPC `upgrade` handler, and the hook-side `executeRecomp`
 * closure (used by `/ctx-recomp` and `/ctx-session-upgrade`). They drifted: the
 * RPC handlers had live progress but no model fallback, while the hook path had
 * fallback but no progress. The dogfood failure on 2026-05-30 was exactly this —
 * the dialog "Run upgrade now" button (RPC, no fallback) failed when the primary
 * historian model returned empty, while `/ctx-session-upgrade` (hook, with
 * fallback) succeeded via the kimi fallback, leaving the sidebar stuck on a
 * stale "failed" because the command path never updated progress.
 *
 * `runManagedRecomp` / `runManagedUpgrade` give EVERY caller the full set:
 * fallback resilience (config chain + live-session-model last resort), live
 * progress (sidebar / status), and consistent terminal-state + messaging.
