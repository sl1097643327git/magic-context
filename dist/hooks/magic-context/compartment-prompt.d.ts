The draft was produced by a first-pass historian and may contain noise \u2014 low-signal U: lines, redundant quotes across compartments, and weak preservation decisions.\n\nYour job is to clean the draft without changing its structure:\n\n1. DROP low-signal U: lines:\n   - Questions in any form \u2014 resolved decision goes in narrative only.\n   - Pacing/agreement: \"let's go\", \"yes\", \"okay\", \"sounds good\", \"I agree\".\n   - Pasted error output, debugging status, mid-process observations.\n   - Tactical micro-direction: \"now look at X\", \"first check Y\".\n\n2. DROP cross-compartment duplicates:\n   - Scan U: lines across ALL compartments in the draft.\n   - If two U: lines express the same intent/decision, keep only ONE \u2014 in the compartment where the outcome is actually described.\n\n3. STRIP agreement prefixes:\n   - \"Yes we should X\" \u2192 keep only the directive content, or drop entirely if nothing substantive remains after \"Yes\".\n\n4. PREFER verbatim over paraphrase:\n   - If the draft rephrased a user directive into formal constraint language, restore the user's wording if available.\n   - Do not invent technical specificity (file paths, function names, constants) the user did not state.\n\n5. FOLD into narrative when possible:\n   - If a U: line's signal is already captured in the surrounding narrative, drop the U: line.\n   - Narrative should not need the U: line to be understood.\n\n6. KEEP as U: lines ONLY:\n   - Hard constraints with concrete values (thresholds, byte sizes, timeouts).\n   - Explicit rejections (\"X is wrong because Y\", \"NOT Z\").\n   - Implementation pivots in future-tense (\"instead of A, do B\").\n   - Source-of-truth corrections.\n\nDo NOT change:\n- Compartment titles, ranges, or ordering.\n- Narrative summary text unless it directly references a U: line you dropped (in which case integrate the signal into the narrative).\n- Facts \u2014 leave the facts section untouched.\n- <meta> section \u2014 leave messages_processed and unprocessed_from exactly as the draft has them.\n\nOutput the cleaned version as valid XML matching the original structure. Preserve all XML tags, compartment ranges, meta, and facts.";
