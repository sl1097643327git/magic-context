/**
 * Prime the raw-message cache for the WHOLE compartment phase, then run it.
 *
 * The phase's boundary resolution (`getRawHistoryEligibility` +
 * `resolveOpenCodeProtectedTailBoundary`) AND the historian runner's
 * `readSessionChunk` all read raw OpenCode history. On a large session an
 * un-primed read is O(session) (multi-second each) and runs on the transform
 * thread — OpenCode awaits `messages.transform` before the LLM call, so a
 * historian-FIRE pass froze ~9.6s at "Thinking". The compartment TRIGGER primes
 * its own scope (`withRawSessionMessageCache` inside `getUnsummarizedTailInfo`),
 * but that scope ends when the trigger returns, so the phase read un-primed.
 *
 * Prime from the TAIL-ONLY DB read (`primeTailRawMessageCache`), NOT the
 * in-memory `args.messages` tail: `extractInMemoryMessageViews` aliases the live
 * `parts` objects, which the transform MUTATES between the trigger and this phase
 * (§N§ prefixes, `[dropped]` sentinels, stripped reasoning). The historian must
 * read RAW content; the DB read is unmutated and O(tail).
 *
 * Scope/await correctness: every raw read happens in the phase's SYNCHRONOUS
 * prefix — `runCompartmentPhaseImpl` is `async` but reaches its first `await`
 * only on the ≥95% blocking path (`awaitCompartmentRun`), and the runner's
 * `readSessionChunk` runs in the runner's own synchronous prefix (before its
 * first `await` at `client.session.get`). `withRawSessionMessageCache`'s
 * try/finally clears the cache the moment the wrapped fn RETURNS its promise
 * (i.e. after the synchronous body suspends at the first await), so the cache
 * covers all raw reads; the only post-await work (`prepareCompartmentInjection`)
 * reads context.db, never raw history. Priming once under `resolvedSessionId`
 * covers the runner too — it reads under `args.sessionId`, which equals
 * `resolvedSessionId` (transform.ts).
