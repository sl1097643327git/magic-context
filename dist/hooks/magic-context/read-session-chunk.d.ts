 * (e.g. Pi) provide their session data through a different surface
 * (`pi.sessionManager.getBranch()`), so they register a per-session
 * provider here BEFORE invoking any code path that calls the shared
 * `readRawSessionMessages` / `getRawSessionMessageCount` /
 * `getProtectedTailStartOrdinal` / `readSessionChunk` helpers.
 *
 * The registry is lookup-by-sessionId: a registered provider takes
 * precedence over the OpenCode-DB default. Sessions never registered
 * here continue to read from OpenCode's DB (existing behavior).
 *
 * Lifecycle: providers should be registered for the duration of one
 * historian/trigger evaluation and unregistered afterward to avoid
 * leaking session state across unrelated plugin instances. The
 * `withSessionMessageProvider` helper enforces this by wrapping a
 * scope.
