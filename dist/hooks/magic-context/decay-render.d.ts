/**
 * Shared deterministic decay renderer (v2). Used by BOTH OpenCode
 * (inject-compartments.ts) and Pi (inject-compartments-pi.ts) so the two
 * harnesses render compartment history byte-identically from the same validated
 * decay curve. This is the single render-side implementation of the curve in
 * `decay-curve.ts`; neither harness may keep a private/approximate copy.
 *
 * Responsibilities:
 *  - Pick a tier per compartment from age + importance + budget pressure
 *    (decay-curve.ts), with budget pressure computed ONCE per pass.
 *  - Render the chosen paraphrase tier (P1..P4); P5 = archived (omitted).
 *  - Legacy (pre-v2, flat-content) compartments: no paraphrase columns, so the
 *    initial tier is P3 when the body has a `U:` line else P4, and the body is
 *    truncated `content`.
 *  - Demote oldest-first under a hard token budget (the curve already fits the
 *    budget, but this guards against estimate drift / very tight budgets).
 *
 * v2 faithful facts: this renderer NEVER emits a <session_facts> block. Facts
 * are promoted to project memory and render via <project-memory>. Callers pass
 * the memory block separately; session facts are not a render input.
