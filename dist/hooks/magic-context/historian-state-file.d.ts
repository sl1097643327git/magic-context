/**
 * Historian state-file offloading.
 *
 * When the existing-state XML (prior compartments + facts + project memory)
 * exceeds {@link HISTORIAN_STATE_INLINE_THRESHOLD} characters, the historian
 * caller writes it to a temp file under the project-local historian dir
 * (`<project>/.opencode/magic-context/historian/`) and the prompt instructs
 * the model to `Read this file first`. This avoids pushing 100K+ chars of
 * inline reference state through the model's input on long sessions, which
 * on some provider/model combinations (notably github-copilot/gpt-5.4 via
 * the openai-responses API) causes the model to stall before emitting any
 * output tokens.
 *
 * The state file lives INSIDE the project directory rather than under
 * `os.tmpdir()` because OpenCode's `external_directory` permission system
 * asks the user before letting the historian subagent's Read tool open any
 * file outside the project. Anchoring under `<project>/.opencode/` keeps
 * the file inside the project boundary so historian runs never trigger a
 * permission prompt.
 *
 * The caller MUST delete the file in finally{} via
 * {@link cleanupHistorianStateFile}.
 *
 * Shared between OpenCode (`compartment-runner-incremental.ts`,
 * `compartment-runner-recomp.ts`) and Pi (`pi-historian-runner.ts`). The
 * directory is resolved from the project directory the caller passes in —
 * both harnesses already track this on their runner deps.
