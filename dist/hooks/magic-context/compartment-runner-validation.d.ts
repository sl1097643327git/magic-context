 * iterates its whole fallback chain, so a single failure is almost always a
 * transient blip (a model hiccup, a provider timeout) that the next turn fixes on

 * worth alarming the user about. 3 mirrors the dreamer circuit-breaker threshold.

/**
 * User-facing notice for a historian (history-comparting) failure. The framing is
 * chosen by `failureCount` so users aren't alarmed by harmless transient blips:
 *
 *   - Below the threshold → calm reassurance: Magic Context retries automatically
 *     on the next turn, nothing is lost, and the conversation continues normally.
 *     We explicitly promise we'll only speak up again if it keeps failing.
 *   - At/above the threshold → escalation: the failures are persistent, so it's
 *     likely the configured historian model is misconfigured or unreachable, with
 *     the last error and the actionable next step (check magic-context.jsonc).
 *
 * Shared by both harnesses so the wording (and the transient/persistent contract)
 * never drifts between OpenCode and Pi.
