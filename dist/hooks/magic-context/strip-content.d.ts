 * block containing signed thinking. The merged block's signature no longer
 * matches the original, triggering:

 *    cannot be modified"

/**
 * Work around @ai-sdk/anthropic's groupIntoBlocks behavior plus opus-4.7's
 * strict thinking-block position validation.
 *
 * Two structural sources of invalid payloads exist, both triggering:
 *   "thinking or redacted_thinking blocks in the latest assistant message
 *    cannot be modified. These blocks must remain as they were in the
 *    original response."
 *
 * (1) ACROSS assistants: @ai-sdk/anthropic's groupIntoBlocks merges
 *     consecutive OpenCode assistant messages into one Anthropic assistant
 *     block. Each source assistant's signed reasoning gets emitted as its
 *     own thinking block — the merged block ends up with thinking
 *     INTERLEAVED between text/tool_use.
 *
 * (2) WITHIN ONE assistant: opus-4.7 with interleaved thinking produces
 *     multiple reasoning parts in a single OpenCode assistant message
 *     (observed: up to 12 reasoning parts per message). AI SDK passes each
 *     through verbatim, again producing interleaved thinking.
 *
 * Both cases can coexist. The only layout opus-4.7 reliably accepts is:
 *   [thinking at index 0 (optional)] followed by text/tool_use only,
 * i.e. AT MOST ONE thinking block per consecutive assistant run, and that
 * thinking block must be the very first non-metadata part.
 *
 * Rule enforced here:
 *   - For each consecutive assistant run, keep AT MOST ONE reasoning part.
 *   - That reasoning part must be the first non-metadata content part of
 *     the first assistant in the run. Otherwise strip all reasoning from
 *     the run.
 *
 * Trade-off: the model loses visibility into its own intermediate-step
 * reasoning for multi-step turns. The first step's reasoning is preserved
 * when possible, which carries enough cache continuity for Anthropic.
 *
 * Upstream bug (track with smart note #38, remove this workaround when
 * fixed): @ai-sdk/anthropic's groupIntoBlocks +
 * convert-to-anthropic-messages-prompt.ts (case 'assistant'). Same class
 * fixed for Bedrock in vercel/ai#13583/#13972.

 *
 * REPLAY/DETECT split — mirrors `dropStaleReduceCalls`, and for the same
 * reason. The empty sentinel is filtered for Anthropic, so the FIRST time a

 * change. The earlier "strip every pass when `maxTag <= watermark`" version
 * keyed that first-strip on the live watermark, which advances with tail
 * growth: a DEFER pass could newly cross an older image message and strip it
 * mid-prefix, busting the Anthropic cache on a pass that must replay
 * byte-identically (observed live — a processed-screenshot message lost its
 * images on a defer pass and collapsed the cached prefix). Freezing the id set
 * on cache-busting passes and replaying it everywhere removes the moving
 * boundary: DETECT (cache-busting passes only) finds newly-aged processed image
 * messages, strips them, and returns their ids to persist; REPLAY (every pass,
 * incl. defer) re-strips only already-frozen ids, byte-identical regardless of
 * how the live array grew.
