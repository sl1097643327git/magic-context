/**
 * Temporal awareness utilities.
 *
 * When enabled via experimental.temporal_awareness, the plugin:
 *   1. Prepends <!-- +Xm --> / <!-- +2h 15m --> / <!-- +3d 4h --> HTML comments
 *      to user messages where the gap since the previous message exceeds
 *      TEMPORAL_AWARENESS_THRESHOLD_SECONDS.
 *   2. Adds start="YYYY-MM-DD" end="YYYY-MM-DD" date attributes to <compartment>
 *      elements in the injected <session-history> block.
 *
 * The gap is measured from the previous message's effective end time:
 *   - Assistant (completed): prev.time.completed
 *   - Assistant (in-flight/aborted): prev.time.created (best available)
 *   - User: prev.time.created (user messages have no completed field)
 *
 * All values are derived deterministically from immutable message timestamps,
 * so injection is stable across transform passes and cache-safe.

 *
 * The marker is prepended BEFORE any §N§ tag added by tagMessages runs after
 * this function, since tagging happens in the normal transform flow and
 * stripTagPrefix re-strips `§N§` on re-tagging — leaving the marker intact
 * between the tag and the user's text on subsequent passes.
