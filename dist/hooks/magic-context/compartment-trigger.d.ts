 *   assignment would be an unverified guess → return undefined so the caller
 *   falls through to the DB-primed read.
 * - Compartments exist but the boundary row has NO message id (legacy rows) →
 *   undefined (DB path, as before).
 * - No compartments (#132 early-session) → the whole array is the session;
 *   ordinals from 1, no anchor needed.
 *
 * Live-verified byte-identical to the DB path on every boundary decision field
 * (offset, protectedTailStart, eligibleEndOrdinal, N, trueRawEligibleTokens,
