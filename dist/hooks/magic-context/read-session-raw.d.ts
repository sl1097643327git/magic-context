 *
 * This is the O(tail) read: it never touches the ~63k pre-boundary rows that the
 * full reader scans just to recover the tail's ordinal base — a number the
 * compaction marker already stores (`end_message` ordinal + `end_message_id`
 * anchor). On a months-long session the full read is O(session) and grows
 * unbounded; this stays flat at the tail size.
 *
 * Anchor semantics: reads rows with `(time_created, id) >= anchor` (INCLUSIVE of
 * the boundary message), in the same sort order as the full reader, filters
 * compaction-summary rows identically, and numbers the kept messages
 * `baseOrdinal, baseOrdinal+1, …`. Including the anchor keeps
 * `messageIdAtOrdinal(baseOrdinal)` real (the full reader has it too) so
 * boundary-edge message ids match.
 *
 * Returns null when the anchor message id isn't found (deleted / legacy
 * compartment without `end_message_id`); the caller then falls back to the full
 * read. `absoluteMessageCount` = `baseOrdinal + (keptTail - 1)` = the exact
 * count the full reader would produce, so every absolute-ordinal consumer lines
 * up.

 *
 * OpenCode hands the transform the post-compaction-marker tail, i.e. the eligible
 * window, already parsed. Ordinals are anchored at the last compartment boundary:
 *
 * - If `anchorMessageId` is found at index k, that message IS the boundary
 *   (ordinal `lastCompartmentEnd`); messages k, k+1, … get ordinals
 *   `lastCompartmentEnd, lastCompartmentEnd+1, …`. Messages before k (compaction
 *   marker lag — already compartmentalized) are dropped, matching the DB tail
 *   which starts AT the anchor.
 * - If the anchor isn't present (it was a summary row OpenCode already filtered,
 *   or marker is ahead), the array is assumed to start at `lastCompartmentEnd+1`
 *   and ordinals run `lastCompartmentEnd+1, …`. `anchorFound=false` flags this so
 *   callers can choose the DB fallback if they don't trust the assumption.
 * - No compartments yet (#132): pass `lastCompartmentEnd=0`,
 *   `anchorMessageId=null` → ordinals from 1 over the whole array.
 *
 * Mirrors the DB reader's contracts: compaction-summary rows
 * (`summary===true && finish==='stop'`) are filtered BEFORE ordinal assignment;
 * a malformed message (no string id) keeps its ordinal slot but yields no element;
 * `absoluteMessageCount` equals what the DB reader would report for the same tail.
 *
 * Returns null when there are no usable messages.
